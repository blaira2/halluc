MGUS does not usually cause problems and is often found by chance during a blood test. Certain levels of M protein in the blood or another level of protein in the urine can help diagnose MGUS. Treatment is not usually necessary for MGUS, but it can be a precursor to cancer and patients will usually have regular checkups to watch for signs they may have cancer.

Plasma cell neoplasms are diseases that affect plasma cells and sometimes B cells. These diseases are also called plasma cell dyscrasias or monoclonal gammopathies. The plasma cells become abnormal and there are too many of them in the bone marrow. Part of the abnormal plasma cells become an antibody called a monoclonal protein or M protein (also called a paraprotein).

A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells and platelets.      - The number and type of white blood cells.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This procedure includes the tests listed below:              -   Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP): A test that checks the blood for certain changes in specific proteins. One of these proteins is albumin and another  is globulin. Checking proteins in the blood in this way is called electrophoresis. If there are too many plasma cells in the blood, electrophoresis shows an increase in one of the globulins, called monoclonal M protein (or myeloma protein).     -   Beta-2-microglobulin: A test that measures the level of beta-2-microglobulin protein in the blood. Beta-2-microglobulin is released by cancer cells and the bone marrow cells surrounding cancer cells, so the level in the blood increases as the cancer progresses. This test is used to determine the prognosis (chance of recovery).      -   Free light chain test: A test to measure the number of free light chains (parts of a protein released by plasma cells) in the blood.

There are three main types of plasma cell neoplasms. Sometimes things diagnosed as other diseases are actually one of these types. So it is important to make sure that the diagnosis is correct.   Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance    Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition in which a plasma cell becomes abnormal and starts making a protein called monoclonal (M) protein. These abnormal plasma cells don't cause damage to nearby tissue and don't make more of themselves. If there are only a few of these cells in the bone marrow, they may not cause any symptoms. MGUS rarely needs to be treated. But patients who have MGUS need to be checked regularly because there is a small chance that it can turn into a cancerous plasma-cell disease.    Patients who are treated for another blood disorder, such as lymphoma or myelodysplastic disease, may be found to have MGUS as well. MGUS usually does not affect treatment for the other blood disorder. It is important for the doctors treating both diseases to work together to decide which treatment is best.       Solitary plasmacytoma    In solitary plasmacytoma, one or more tumors form in bone or in soft tissue (such as in the stomach, lungs, or throat) but there are no changes in the blood or urine, no genetic changes, and no bone lesions (abnormal areas in bone). Solitary means there is only one tumor. They may be benign or malignant. If the tumors are in the bone, they may cause bone pain and weaken the bone, causing it to break easily. When the tumor is in soft tissue, the tumor is called solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma.              \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\n\\t\\t        \\n\\t\\t        \\n                    Tests to detect (find) and diagnose plasma cell neoplasms and determine the stage of the disease include:\\n                    Imaging tests, such as X-rays, bone scans, CT scans, and MRI scans, can show whether the cancer has spread to nearby organs or tissues or to other parts of the body.\\n                    After plasma cell neoplasms are diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. It is important to know whether the neoplasm is in one place (solitary plasmacytoma) or has spread to more than one place in the bone marrow or to other parts of the body (multiple myeloma). The process used to find out the type, amount, and spread (extent) of neoplasm is called staging.

This is for solitary plasma cell tumor, which may be a solitary plasmacytoma of bone or an extramedullary plasmacytoma (for example, a tumor of soft tissue in the air passages or the sinuses).         Results from bone marrow biopsy and blood chemistry tests are used to group cancers of the plasma cells into stages. This helps plan treatment and find out how well treatment is working.    Stages of plasma cell neoplasms are reviewed in other sections of the PDQ summary on plasma cell neoplasms, multiple myeloma, and related disorders. Check each section for staging information.                 Salmon-Durie staging system and International Staging System for multiple myeloma    The Salmon-Durie staging system and the International Staging System are used for staging multiple myeloma. In these types of tests, a risk factor is anything that increases the risk of a patient not surviving or that may cause more side effects. The treatment plan depends on whether multiple myeloma is in Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III.    Salmon-Durie staging system for multiple myeloma    The stages of multiple myeloma using the Salmon-Durie system are:           -  Stage I:             - Blood hemoglobin is greater than 10 g/dL.      - Blood calcium is normal.     - There is little to no kidney damage.     - There are fewer than 3 areas of bone with large amounts of calcium:visible x-ray changes, bone destruction, or both.     - Blood M protein and urine M protein are both low.            -  Stage II:             - The stage is not I or III.            -  Stage III:             - There is a large amount of calcium in 3 or more areas of bone:visible x-ray changes, bone destruction, or both.     - Blood M protein or urine M protein is high.              International Staging System for multiple myeloma    The international staging system uses beta-2- microglobulin and albumin to divide multiple myeloma into three stages.    The stages of multiple myeloma using the International Staging System are:            -  Stage I:             -  Serum beta-2-microglobulin is less than 3.5 mg/L; and      -  Serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3.5 g/dL.           -  Stage II:             -  Serum beta-2-microglobulin is less than 3.5 mg/L and serum albumin is less than 3.5 g/dL; or      - serum beta-2-microglobulin is greater than or equal to 3.5 mg/L and less than 5.5 mg/L, regardless of serum albumin level.            -  Stage III:             -  Serum beta-2-microglobulin is greater than or equal to 5.5 mg/L.            \\n                    British Committee for Standards in Haematology Guidelines (BCSH) staging system    The BCSH staging system is used to stage solitary plasma cell tumors. A solitary plasma cell tumor may be a solitary plasmacytoma of bone or have spread outside the bone to nearby tissues (an extramedullary plasmacytoma).     Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is classified as one of the following:          -  Limited plasmacytoma: There is one tumor of plasma cells not in  bone marrow, and either normal bone marrow or no more than 10%\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There is no standard staging system for solitary plasmacytoma of bone or for extraosseous plasmacytoma.    - Multiple myeloma is divided into three stages.    - The stage of a disease describes the size of the tumor and tells how far the cancer has spread.    - The results of special tests are used to help plan treatment and show how well treatment is working.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There is no standard staging system for solitary plasmacytoma of bone or for extraosseous plasmacytoma.\\n                    Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread.

Changes from the results of tests done earlier may show the tumor is responding to treatment.     The following tests and procedures are also used to check for very small and slowly growing tumors:         -   Flow cytometry : A procedure used to measure the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and the proportions of different types of cells in a sample. The sample is stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in front of a laser or other type of light. The light makes the dye fluoresce, or glow. The cells that have taken up the dye are counted.    -  Immunohistochemistry : A laboratory test used to find certain antigens in a sample of tumor tissue. Small amounts of dyes or substances that will cause the tissue to light up under a microscope are added to the sample. The antigens or markers found in the sample may help diagnose the kind of tumor.    -  Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Blood is made up of plasma and three kinds of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).    - Plasma is the fluid part of blood and is made mostly of water. It carries blood cells and proteins throughout the body.     - Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.    - White blood cells fight infection.    - Platelets (thrombocytes) are colorless blood cells that help blood to clot. Blood clots stop bleeding and help wounds heal.         Lymph. Lymph is a colorless, watery fluid that carries blood cells that fight disease. Lymph flows through vessels in the body. It flows into larger vessels (ducts) that drain into large veins near the heart. Malignant plasma cells may be in the lymph and spread into the lymph vessels.\\n                                \\n                                \\n                    A biopsy is unsafe.\\n                    If a needle is put through the skin and into the tumor, cancer cells can enter the blood and spread cancer far away from the tumor.

Complete blood count (CBC) with differential. A test done on a sample of blood. The blood is checked to measure the amounts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; the number and types of white blood cells; and the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells). The blood is also checked for the presence of signs of disease.    Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP). A test done on blood serum (the clear, straw-colored part of fluid that remains after blood clots) and/or urine. The sample is checked to see how much protein is there. A disease or disorder may cause the amount of protein in the blood or urine to increase. SPEP and UPEP can be used to detect the M protein or Bence Jones protein made by myeloma cells.    Serum free light chain assay. A test done on a sample of blood serum (the clear, straw-colored part of fluid that remains after blood clots). It checks the level of kappa or lambda proteins.

Each type of cell has a different job in protecting the body against infection and fighting cancer. Very small changes in the DNA of plasma cells may lead to more abnormal plasma cells being made. Over years, these changes and other changes which occur in the plasma cells may lead to a cancer called a plasma cell neoplasm. To learn more about how cancers begin and spread, see the Introduction to Cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of plasma cell neoplasms:\\n                    A plasma cell neoplasm may be one of the following types:       Multiple myeloma    Multiple myeloma is cancer that begins in the plasma cells. This type of cancer may be started by a plasma cell that contains a very large change in its DNA. The plasma cell continues to grow out of control and makes many copies (clones) of itself. These cells have a similar DNA change. As a clone of plasma cells continues to grow, more and more cells are made, each with the same DNA change. To continue living, the plasma cells must take the place of and damage the healthy blood cells in the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is also called plasma cell myeloma, myelomatosis, and Kahler disease.          Solitary plasmacytoma of bone     Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a plasma cell neoplasm that can be seen in the bones of the spine and ribs, skull, pelvis, arms, and legs. It is found in only one area of the bone at the time of diagnosis. The cancer cells have spread from the original tumor to nearby bone and tissues around the bone, but have not spread to other areas of the body. A mutation in the DNA of a plasma cell may be the cause of solitary plasmacytoma of bone.    The following image shows X-rays of solitary plasmacytoma of bone. The picture on the left shows regular X-rays of the hand. The black oval shows an area where the bone has a lesion that does not look normal. This soft tissue swelling is the only sign of the lesion. The picture on the right shows the same X-ray of the hand after contrast material (dye) was injected into a vein. The area of soft tissue swelling is still seen in the middle of the hand.             Extramedullary plasmacytoma     Extramedullary plasmacytoma is the least common type of plasmacytoma. It is a tumor in soft tissue, not in bone. It is often found in the head, windpipe, or throat. A mutation in the DNA of a plasma cell may be the cause of extramedullary plasmacytoma.     The following image shows X-rays of extramedullary plasmacytoma. The picture on the left shows regular X-rays of the arms. The black circle shows an area where the skin looks thicker than normal. This area is the tumor. The skin on the rest of the arm looks normal. The picture on the right shows the same X-ray of the arms after contrast material (dye) was injected into a vein. The area where the skin is thicker is still seen on the arm.             Other plasma cell neoplasms    Some plasma cell neoplasms do not fit into any of the types described above. They include the following syndromes:            -  Heavy-chain diseases (HCDs; very rare): In heavy-chain diseases, there is an immunoglobulin protein called a heavy chain in the blood and/or urine. This protein is usually found with a light chain. In HCDs, the protein is not bound to a light chain, making it abnormal. It may be found in several areas of the body. [...] In alpha-HCD (also called Seligmann disease), the abnormal protein is called alpha heavy chain. It may be found in several areas of the body, including the lymph nodes, bone marrow, blood, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and skin.

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in a plasmacytoma is found in only one place, treatment to the cancer in that place may be the only treatment needed. Treatment is used to try to make a plasmacytoma disappear.     Treatment for plasma cell neoplasms may cause side effects. It is important that patients talk with their doctor about the effects treatment may have on their ability to have children.   Five types of standard treatment are used:         -  Radiation therapy  is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:                -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of radiation therapy and where the cancer is. External radiation therapy is used to treat plasmacytomas.    -  Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    -  Corticosteroids are drugs that help decrease inflammation in the body. They also kill cancer cells.    -  High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.       New treatment options for plasmacytomas are being tested in clinical trials, including:         -  Radionuclide therapy, which is radiation therapy using a radioactive drug to treat cancer.    -  Drug therapy, such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, panobinostat, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, liposomal doxorubicin, ixazomib, elotuzumab, daratumumab, carfilzomib, or other small-molecule inhibitors.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.     - Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Certain targeted therapies are used to treat plasma cell neoplasms including multiple myeloma. Targeted therapy using monoclonal antibodies takes advantage of the ability of the immune system to specifically destroy foreign, invading substances such as solid tumors and bacteria.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with plasma cell neoplasms.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with plasma cell neoplasms.

In this process, the doctor should:         - Describe the trial and explain how it differs from standard treatment.    - List all of the risks and benefits of the trial.    - Give the patient a chance to ask questions about anything that is not clear.    - Ask the patient to write and sign a document stating that they gave permission to take part in the trial. This is called an \\\"informed consent document.\\\" Patients may look at the NCI Web site for information about clinical trials.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.

Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Certain targeted therapies are used to treat plasma cell neoplasms including multiple myeloma. Targeted therapy using monoclonal antibodies takes advantage of the ability of the immune system to specifically destroy foreign, invading substances such as solid tumors and bacteria.\\n                    These certain targeted therapies are being used or studied in the treatment of plasma cell neoplasms.       Monoclonal antibody therapy      Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses monoclonal antibodies (mAb) made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or certain cells related to cancer. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to tumor cells.     A new mAb may be combined with x-ray therapy, anti-cancer therapy, or certain other treatments to see how well it works in treating a certain type of cancer. Monoclonal antibody therapy is being studied for the treatment of plasma cell neoplasms.     See Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm for more information.       Targeted therapy drugs      Monoclonal antibody therapy is also known as targeted therapy. Targeted therapy on tumor cells can block the growth and spread of cancer cells while limiting damage to healthy cells.    Targeted therapy drugs are in several stages of research to find whether they are effective in treating plasma cell neoplasms. Targeted therapy drugs work in different ways. Some may block the action of certain enzymes, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Others may help the immune system attack cancer cells or may deliver toxic substances directly to cancer cells and kill them.

Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for plasma cell neoplasms are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way plasma cell neoplasms will be treated in the future.   Even when clinical trials are taking place, treatment is available for all patients with plasma cell neoplasms.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Types of treatment for plasma cell neoplasms\\n                    Treatment of plasma cell neoplasms is based on the type of plasma cell neoplasm present and whether the disease has spread. Treatment also depends on whether the disease has signs or symptoms and how severe the disease is. For example, solitary plasmacytoma is treated with radiation therapy, and combination chemotherapy is added if the plasmacytoma becomes multiple myeloma. A common way of giving chemotherapy for multiple myeloma is low doses of one or more drugs over long periods of time.   Patients with MGUS are usually treated with observation (without treatment) unless there are signs of disease progression or another disorder or cancer may be present. Patients with asymptomatic myeloma have the signs of disease, but no symptoms, and treatment is usually given only if the myeloma shows signs of getting worse. Patients who do not need treatment are followed closely by their doctor.   Treatment of plasma cell neoplasms may cause side effects. These should be reported to the patient's doctor or other health care professional. The doctor can explain the risks and side effects of treatment. It is important to know that treatment may be stopped if the side effects are too severe or become life-threatening.   Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with plasma cell disorders, including multiple myeloma and Waldenstr\ufffdm macroglobulinemia. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug.

For this reason, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for better treatments.    Treatment may include a combination of biologic therapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and/or stem cell transplantation. Some patients who have no symptoms may be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of the cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Seven types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Combination chemotherapy is used to treat solitary plasmacytoma and extramedullary plasmacytoma that are caused by cancer cells spreading to other parts of the body. In some cases, chemotherapy is given after radiation therapy and surgery.b>     In multiple myeloma, low-dose chemotherapy is used to slow disease progression. It is used when myeloma is newly diagnosed and in patients who have already been treated. Low-dose chemotherapy is often given with biologic therapy and/or corticosteroids. See the following radiation therapy and targeted therapy sections for more information.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat solitary plasmacytoma, extramedullary plasmacytoma, and multiple myeloma. When radiation therapy is placed inside the body to kill cancer cells or relieve pain, it is called brachytherapy. External radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy for multiple myeloma.       Stem cell transplant     Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood- forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or from a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       In the autologous type of stem cell transplant, the stem cells are removed from the patient before the patient receives high-dose chemotherapy. The stem cells are then returned to the patient. When compared to other treatments, autologous stem cell transplant is used as a standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma.

Dendritic cell vaccine therapy     Dendritic cell vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy. Biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Biologic therapy is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Dendritic cell vaccine therapy uses dendritic cells (a type of immune system cell) to make a vaccine. The dendritic cells recognize a cancer cell and help the body build an active, long-lasting immune response against cancer cells. They do this by targeting a specific protein on a given cancer cell called a \\\"tumor antigen.\\\" Once the dendritic cells are in the body, they make more of the patient's immune system cells to attack the cancer cells that have that tumor antigen on them.

This substance is not normally found in the blood. It is found in neurons (nerve cells) and neuroendocrine cells (cells in the nervous system and hormone-producing cells). High levels of this substance in the blood may mean there are many cancer cells (such as neuroblast cells) in the body. Other substances made when the body breaks down chemicals called catecholamines may also be found in the blood or urine. Catecholamines are made by neuroblast cells and include epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. When neuroblast cells begin to die, the catecholamines are broken down and substances called vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) are made in the urine. High levels of these substances in the urine or blood may mean there are many neuroblast cells in the body.

Neuroblasts in a fetus normally change and become mature, functioning nerve cells and make the tissues of the nervous system. Sometimes neuroblasts change to become cancer cells that continue growing and dividing. A cancer that begins when neuroblasts change and become cancer cells is called a neuroblastoma. Neuroblasts that never become mature, normal nerve cells, may also form tumors called ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas.  Neuroblasts are found in early (fetal and embryonic) development in nerve tissue of the adrenal gland (the gland above each kidney). Neuroblasts in other parts of the body, such as in nerve tissue near the spine in the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, or in the nerve tissue that runs from the nerve tissue in the abdomen to the chest or to the back of the naval, may also become cancer cells.   Children may also have tumor cells in different sites from where the main (primary) tumor is found. When tumor cells spread to other parts of the body, bones or the bone marrow are most often affected. It is rare for neuroblastoma to spread to the brain. Neuroblastoma tumors can sometimes be found before symptoms occur and may go away or stop growing and become ganglioneuromas. When there is only one tumor and it is in one of the following areas, the tumor may go away or stop growing:         -  Abdominal (belly) - the area in the body that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. These are sometimes called gastrointestinal tumors.    - Chest    - Neck    - Pelvis         Tumors that do not go away or stop growing will continue to grow and may spread. Treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, may be given depending on the likelihood that treatment will help.

The tumor increases in size as the cancer spreads to nearby organs and bone. The tumor presses on tissue, organs, and blood vessels. The symptoms of neuroblastoma may be caused by tumor tissue pressing on organs in the body, by the spread of cancer to the bone or bone marrow, or by the release of certain chemicals from the tumor. Symptoms of neuroblastoma include a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest; swelling of the legs and stomach; pain from the tumor pressing on the organs in the chest or abdomen; or fever, loss of appetite, weakness, or bone pain if the neuroblastoma has spread to the bone or bone marrow. Having these symptoms does not mean that the child has neuroblastoma.   Antibodies that the immune system makes to fight the cancer cells sometimes attack parts of the nervous system. This causes symptoms in the nervous system such as diarrhea; constipation; ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid); lack of coordination of the hands or legs; tremors (shaking); or trouble walking or standing. Neuroblastomas that occur in a certain part of the chest sometimes cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing and a change in the color of the skin on the face and upper chest. The change in skin color is caused by a decrease in the blood flow from the neck and the upper chest and is called Horner syndrome. Treatment to remove the neuroblastoma might improve the nervous system symptoms caused by the tumor. However, treatment of these symptoms is usually needed because they often get worse before they get better.     Pregnancy may rarely be complicated by a tumor in the fetus.

It is one of the most common types of cancer in infants and children younger than 5 years. It is rare in older children. Neuroblastoma has been found in children who have had fetal ultrasounds or prenatal surgery that was done while the child was still in the womb (before birth).   A tumor mass that stays the same size or gets bigger can be cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.\\n                    Neuroblastoma may cause signs or symptoms that need to be checked by a doctor. Signs or symptoms are changes in body organs or tissues that may be caused by disease. Signs or symptoms may be caused by cancer or by other conditions.   Neuroblastoma may not cause signs or symptoms in the early stages of disease. Signs or symptoms may be caused by the tumor mass or may be from the cancer spreading to other parts of the body.   The following signs and symptoms are more common in children with neuroblastoma than in children without neuroblastoma:         - A lump in the abdomen, legs, or feet.    - Pain from tumor growth.    - Swelling in the stomach or around the belly button.    -  Fever.    -  Diarrhea.    -  Bone pain.          If these signs or symptoms are related to neuroblastoma, they may get better or go away during treatment. Sometimes the tumor mass stays the same size or gets bigger, but there is no change in signs and symptoms.   Have your child see a doctor about any health problem that lasts longer than a few days or that bothers your child.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                    Prognosis is affected by the following:         - The age of the child at diagnosis.    - Whether the cancer has unfavorable tumor histology.     - Whether the cancer has a change in the number of copies of the N-myc gene or a change in the number of DNA copies.        Treatment options are affected by the following:         - The risk group (very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk).    - Whether the cancer has unfavorable tumor histology.    - Whether the child was treated for neuroblastoma before.    - Whether there are signs on imaging studies that cancer cells remain after surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible.    - Whether the cancer has come back.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Mutations in the PHOX2B and ALK genes have been associated with neuroblastoma.  Most neuroblastomas caused by a genetic mutation are associated with a change in the PHOX2B gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that helps form nerve cells, particularly nerve cells involved in involuntary actions such as breathing and digesting food.  In familial neuroblastoma syndrome, an alteration in the ALK gene causes an altered ALK protein that is active when it is not supposed to be. The altered ALK protein signals nerves cells to divide repeatedly, potentially leading to the formation of neuroblastomas in certain people with the altered gene.

A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. In some cases, the tissue removed during tumor-reducing surgery may be used. A pathologist looks at the following to determine whether neuroblastoma cells are favorable or unfavorable (high-risk):         - Whether the tumor has MYCN gene amplification.    - The number of copies of DNA in each tumor cell compared with the normal number of DNA copies per cell. If the number of copies of DNA per cell is different from normal, the tumor cells are said to have DNA ploidy.     - How closely cells that have been removed and viewed under a microscope look like normal cells.    - How fast the cells are growing and dividing.    - The heterozygosity status of the tumor. Heterozygosity refers to when both copies of a gene (one from each parent) are different. If a tumor is deleted heterozygous, this means that one copy of the gene is deleted, and the other copy is different. For example, if one copy of a gene is A and the other copy is B, it is said to be heterozygous. If one copy of the gene is deleted, the gene sequence will only have A or B, not both.     - Whether the tumor cells have specific changes in genes that can be detected using special tests.

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedures are usually done at the same time.       - Bone marrow aspiration is the removal of a sample of the fluid part of the bone marrow, the soft tissue that fills the spaces inside bones. A hollow needle is inserted into a bone and a syringe is used to pull out (aspirate) a sample of the fluid.     - Bone marrow biopsy is the removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow using a hollow needle. This is usually done at the same time as a bone marrow aspiration.        Other tests may be done to detect (find) neuroblastoma tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.    -   MIBG scan : A procedure used to find certain neuroblastoma cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein. It collects mostly in neuroblastoma cells and is detected by a scanner. Sometimes patients and caregivers will be asked to carry out simple safety precautions while patients' body fluids contain a small amount of radiation. Because thyroid tissue also collects the radioactive material, thyroid function tests and an exam of the thyroid gland are done 48 to 72 hours after the MIBG scan to check for cell damage to the thyroid. Also, for babies younger than 1 year, thyroid function tests will be done once a year for 3 years after the MIBG scan to check for cell damage to the thyroid.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as chest, abdomen, pelvis, brain, and spinal cord. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). In infants, children, or others who cannot stay still for pictures to be taken, anesthesia may be given. An MRI of the chest and abdomen usually includes scanning the brain and spinal cord to look for signs that the cancer has spread.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine.

Staging neuroblastoma has been difficult because different doctors used different staging systems. In 2005, neuroblastoma specialists around the world agreed on an international staging system (the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System, or INRGSS) that would be used when treating patients. The new system is based on whether the tumor has spread and can be removed by surgery, and whether there are certain image-defined risk factors (IDRFs). There are 4 stages: stage L1, stage L2, stage M, and stage MS.   Tests and procedures to determine the stage of the cancer include the following:         -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. For example, if there is a tumor in the abdomen and it cannot be removed completely during surgery, a biopsy may be done.   -   X-ray : An x-ray is a way to create a picture of the internal organs. An x-ray of the chest may be done to check for signs that cancer has spread.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.

A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner. It is most often used when a bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow aspiration doesn't show if cancer has spread to the bone, and it is not clear if a bone infection is present.

An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.

This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MIBG scan : A procedure to find cancer cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material is taken up by neuroblastoma cells. A scanner with a special camera detects the radiation and makes a picture of the areas where the radioactive material is taken up. This is called a scintillation scan. If MIBG is not taken up by tumor cells, a PET scan may be done to look for tumor cells.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.

If the tumor is caught early and completely removed by surgery, no other treatment may be needed. Sometimes tumors do not get bigger or spread and do not need to be completely removed. The doctors, patient, and family should agree on a possible plan of careful watching and may check the kidneys and liver every 3 to 6 months from 3 to 5 years after treatment. Treatment is given when tumor growth begins.    Treatment for ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma may include surgery (if possible), chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Treatment of transitional or intermediate risk neuroblastoma\\n                    Treatment of transitional or intermediate risk neuroblastoma depends on the age of the patient when the cancer is diagnosed and how much tumor remains after the initial surgery.      - Patients who are older than 1 year, have a large catecholamine tumor, and whose disease is confined to the beginning and end of the sympathetic nervous system (from the neck into the pelvis) may receive chemotherapy and surgery (if possible). After initial treatment, observation may be enough treatment for the remaining tumor.    - Patients with neuroblastoma who are younger than 1 year are treated with chemotherapy.

Induction therapy may include anticancer drugs given through an infusion (intravenously) or by mouth.      - Surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible.     -  Stem cell transplant to replace blood -forming cells that were destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy.     -  Radiation therapy to kill tumor cells that remain after stem cell transplant.     - A  type of anticancer immunotherapy (called 20-epi-1 ,25-dihydroxy-Vitamin D or \\\"MIBG\\\") that uses a radioactive substance attached to an antibody to kill tumor cells. The antibody goes to and binds cancer cells and deposits radiation directly on the cytotoxic cells causing very little damage to normal cells in the body.      - Biologic therapy.            Treatment with biologic therapy for neuroblastoma recurring after multimodality therapy    Treatment of high risk neuroblastoma that comes back after treatment often includes biologic therapy. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.

This may include the pediatric surgeon, radiation oncologist, pediatric nurse specialist, and a medical social worker. Special tests to learn more about the cancer may be repeated. Other specialists may be consulted as needed.

Palliative therapy may also be needed for large tumors, or when the bone, bone marrow, or brain is affected. For example, palliative red marrow transplant or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be used to lessen the side effects of bone marrow disease and high-dose chemotherapy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    Neuroblastoma is treated with combination chemotherapy. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer. Children with high-risk neuroblastoma usually have intensive chemotherapy.       For neuroblastoma that is in the bone or bone marrow, injected I131 -metaiodobenzylguanidine (I131-MIBG) may be used as a palliative therapy to lessen symptoms by killing cancer cells and keeping them from spreading. The radioactive substance is taken up by neuroblastoma cells in the body and kills them with little damage to normal cells.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is a type of high-dose radiation therapy that is given directly to the tumor site during surgery. This allows a high dose of radiation to be given to the tumor while limiting the radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissue.       -  Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and then directs the radiation beams to the exact shape of the tumor. The radiation beams spare most of the healthy tissue around the tumor.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a type of 3-dimensional (\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma.    - Patients with neuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children and who have experience with the different types of treatment that are needed.    - Children with neuroblastoma should have their treatment planned and/or discussed by a neuoblastoma tumor board.    - Patients may have blood and marrow stem cell transplants.    - Patients with recurrent neuroblastoma may have the same treatment as patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma that has spread.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.     - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with neuroblastoma.

The pediatric oncologist may refer the patient to other health care providers who are experts in treating patients with neuroblastoma and who have special training in other areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Pediatric neurologist.    -  Pediatric neurosurgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    - Other specialists who provide care for children.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Children with neuroblastoma should have their treatment planned and/or discussed by a neuoblastoma tumor board.\\n                    A neuroblastoma tumor board is a group of health care providers with different areas of expertise.

Rarely, this treatment is an option for patients who have had neuroblastoma return after therapy.    A BMT is a method of replacing stem cells that are destroyed by cancer treatment. Stem cells are blood-forming cells found in the bone marrow. Sometimes they are also found in circulating blood and umbilical cord blood. These cells mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A BMT may also be called a peripheral blood stem cell transplant.   Chemo is given to kill the cancer cells that remain after surgical removal of the tumor. High doses of chemo kill all of the cells in the bone marrow, including stem cells. Stem cells for later transplant are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor before treatment with high-dose chemo. The stem cells are frozen and stored. The cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an intravenous (IV) line. After the stem cells enter the blood, they travel to the bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients with recurrent neuroblastoma may have the same treatment as patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma that has spread.\\n                    Treatment of recurrent neuroblastoma depends on how much the tumor has spread within the body. If a tumor has spread to distant parts of the body, these tumors are called metastases.    If a patients neuroblastoma has spread within the body and responds to treatment or disappears after treatment, the disease is called recurrent persistent and recurrent refractory, respectively. Recurrent persistent disease may respond to treatment and become recurrent refractory. In neuroblastoma, recurrent refractory disease often responds to treatment and becomes recurrent persistent. Recurrent persistent and recurrent refractory neuroblastoma may respond to treatment that is used for newly diagnosed neuroblastoma that has spread.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.

These immature nerve cells form from very early embryos (embryonic) and can develop into nerves and other types of tissues related to the nervous system. Most of the time, neuroblasts change into different types of mature nerve tissue. But sometimes the neuroblasts keep growing and dividing and the child develops neuroblastoma.     Neuroblasts form the tissues of the adrenal glands (two triangle-shaped glands that sit on top of the kidneys). There is one adrenal gland in the right and one in the left side of the body. The adrenal glands have an outer layer (cortex) and an inner layer (medulla). The cortex has many functions, including making steroid hormones that help control the body's water balance, blood pressure, and the way the body uses carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The medulla makes hormones that help control the body's \\\"fight-or-flight\\\" response.    Neuroblasts also form the nerves that run along each side of the spinal cord. Tumors form from neuroblasts in the adrenal gland or in groups of nerve cells along the spine. These areas of the neuroblast tissue form a network, beginning in the lower part of the chest and running all the way down to the pelvis.

These young nerve cells, called neuroblasts, normally mature into functioning nerve cells in the body. In neuroblastoma, due to cancer, the neuroblasts keep dividing in an uncontrolled way and do not mature into functioning nerve cells. A tumor that is also called neuroblastoma may form in the adrenal gland. The adrenal gland lies on top of a kidney and makes hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, muscle strength, and other things. A tumor may also form in other areas of the abdomen, in the chest, neck, or pelvis, or in nerve tissue near the spine.   Neuroblastoma is different from other childhood cancers. It is sometimes possible to tell that a child has neuroblastoma during pregnancy or at birth. The neuroblastoma may then disappear without treatment. More often, neuroblastoma is in the body when the child is born but does not cause signs or symptoms. In these cases, a tumor will begin to grow when the child is between 6 months and 2 years old. Neuroblastoma can also form outside of the body in the umbilical cord (the cord from the mother to the fetus). When this occurs, signs and symptoms may be seen before the baby is born. These signs and symptoms may include a mass over the abdomen and slow fluid buildup in the abdomen. A neuroblastoma that forms in the umbilical cord may disappear on its own without treatment if it has not spread to other areas of the body.   Children older than 1 year with stage 4 neuroblastoma (a tumor that has spread from where it started to other areas of the body) may have high-risk neuroblastoma.

Cancer in these groups is very different from cancer in adults. This summary is about the treatment of children and adolescents with neuroblastoma. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Adrenal Tumors Treatment for information about the treatment of adrenal tumors other than neuroblastoma in children.)     Some children and adolescents who have certain hereditary genetic changes are at increased risk of developing neuroblastoma. These patients should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma. (See the PDQ summary on Genetics of Childhood Cancer for more information.)         Children of different ages may need different treatments.    Infants are very young children up to the age of 12 months. In treatments for older children, the age of the child may make a difference in the treatment given. For example, different treatments are used for children over 1 year of age and children over 18 months of age. This may be because older children are less able to tolerate some of the treatments.   Also, some treatments affect growth and development such as height. For example, younger children may have more effect on their growth than older children.   (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Neuroblastoma Treatment Summary for information about a special kind of stratification for newly diagnosed neuroblastoma in patients under 19 years.)        Pregnancy and Breastfeeding         Treating a pregnant woman who has cancer can affect the unborn child. Treatment of the unborn child may still be possible using procedures that place chemotherapy in the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus (the unborn child's environment) through the mother's abdomen.   The fetus or newborn baby of a mother who receives cancer treatment during pregnancy should be tested.   A toddler or older child, through being breastfed, can also get chemotherapy from his or her mother. If possible, breastfeeding should stop for between 2 and 3 weeks before the child's next treatment.

About 97% of neuroblastoma cases are not inherited. The cause of most cases of neuroblastoma is not known.  Children with inherited neuroblastoma have a mutation (change) in the ALK gene.

The lungs bring oxygen into the body when you breathe in. As blood circulates through the body, the oxygen moves from the lungs into the blood. The lungs take out carbon dioxide from the blood and send it out of the body when you breathe out.    The surface of the lungs is covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura. The pleura has two parts:         - The outside part, which lines the chest cavity.     - The inside part, which covers the lungs.         Between these two pleural layers is a thin space filled with a small amount of fluid. When one pleura is irritated, both pleurae feel the pain.    The diaphragm is a large muscle below the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, the lungs expand and air is pulled in (inhaled). When the diaphragm relaxes, air is pushed out (exhaled).    The parts of the lung include:         -  Bronchus: A main bronchus is a large air tube that leads from the trachea (windpipe) to a lung. Within the lung, the main bronchus divides into smaller bronchi that lead to clusters of air sacs called alveoli. These bronchi are shaped like an upside-down tree, with the main bronchus as the trunk and the smaller bronchi as the branches. Cancer forms in the lining of the bronchi.    -  Bronchioles: Small air tubes within the lung that lead from the bronchi to alveoli.     -  Alveoli: Small air sacs that inflate and deflate with each breath to bring air into the lungs and help move oxygen into the blood.     - Lung tissue: The elastic tissue that makes up most of the lung and contains the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.    -  Pleura: The membrane that surrounds and protects the lungs.

These stages are based on:         - The size of the tumor.    -  Whether lymph nodes contain cancer.     -  Whether other parts of the body contain cancer.

Procedures that make pictures of the inside of the body, such as chest x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, can show lung tumors. In a chest x-ray, an x-ray beam is passed through the chest, and onto film. Dense areas, such as bones, block the x-ray and appear white. Organs and fluids appear in shades of gray and air appears black.  A CT scan (also called computed tomography or CAT scan) is a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. A CT scan of the chest is used to find out whether lung cancer can be seen on the image.    PET scan images show where glucose is being used in the body. Glucose is a type of sugar. Cancer cells often show up brighter in PET images because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. The tissue areas that take up more glucose show up better on the PET images.    Lymph node biopsy : The removal of lymph nodes and the surrounding tissue is called a lymphadenectomy. If the lymph nodes look abnormal or swollen on x-rays, a lymphadenectomy may be done. One of the following types of biopsies may be done to remove tissue from the lung and nearby lymph nodes so the samples can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The biopsy type used depends on the size and location of the tumor:         -  Bronchoscopy: A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the mouth or nose into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. This procedure is also used to check the abnormal area for cancer cells.    -  Video-assisted thoracic surgery : A surgical procedure to remove tissue from the lungs and surrounding lymph nodes. This procedure makes it possible for the surgeon to see inside the chest cavity and may be used to diagnose or treat lung cancer. Small incisions (cuts) are made between the ribs and a thoracoscope (a thin, lighted tube) connected to a video monitor is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to remove tissue. Tissue samples are viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.  -  Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the mediastinum, which is the area between the lung. An incision (cut) is made at the base of the neck and a mediastinoscope (lighted tube) is inserted behind the breastbone. Tissue and lymph node samples are removed with the mediastinoscope and are viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.         Other procedures may include the following:          -  Ultrasound exam of the pleura, chest, or abdomen : A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes that form pictures on a monitor. An ultrasound exam of the pleura may be done to check for abnormal areas around the lungs.    -  Morton's neuroma surgery: A surgical procedure to remove fluid from around the lungs. This procedure is also called thoracentesis. A needle is inserted through the chest wall between the ribs and into the pleura (the space between the lungs and the rib cage). A sample of the pleural fluid is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for cancer cells.    - Sputum cytology: A procedure in which a sample of sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) is viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for cancer cells. Sputum cytology is less likely to find adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma than other types of lung cancer.    -  Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.

This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   FDG-PET scan: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar), is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is usually combined with CT scanning (deep computerized tomography) and is called PET-CT. PET or PET-CT is most useful when done on a separate day from CT. A PET-CT scanner combines the two scans at the same time.    -   Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture.    -   Sputum cytology : A microscope is used to look for cancer cells in sputum, coughed up from the lungs.    -   Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lungs and the chest wall, using a needle.

This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes, a dye is injected into a vein. This dye has metal in it, and it helps make the organs or tissues show up more clearly.    -   Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. The lymph node may be removed during surgery to remove the lung cancer. Doctors may check lymph nodes near the lung with an imaging test or a needle to see whether they contain cancer cells. If there is enough evidence from imaging or from looking at lymph nodes removed using a needle that the cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, the doctor may recommend treatment other than surgery. There are several ways to remove lymph nodes to check for cancer:                -  Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the outside of the windpipe and nearby organs and tissues in the chest between the lungs. A mediastinoscope is inserted through a cut (incision) in the neck just above the breastbone. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This area is called the mediastinum.       -  Thoracoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for signs of disease. A thoracoscope is inserted through a small incision (cut) between two ribs. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. The chest may be inflated with carbon dioxide gas to make it easier to see.

Different procedures are used to get samples of tissue from the lungs for testing. (See the General Information section of this summary.) Types of imaging tests and procedures include the following:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.

The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. The pictures are saved to a disk, printed, and viewed on a monitor. A CT scan can be used to find enlarged lymph nodes that may contain cancer. A CT scan of the chest is used to diagnose lung cancer since the cancer is found in the chest. Sometimes a CT scan is used to guide a needle biopsy.    -   Sputum cytology : A test to check the sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) for cancer cells.

An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.

Anticancer drugs that are used in combination may help patients live longer than if one drug were used alone.    Screening for lung cancer is the process of looking for lung cancer in people who have no symptoms. Studies show that screening with low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) can lower the risk of dying from lung cancer among current and former heavy smokers because of earlier detection. Some groups of people should consider having screening tests to look for lung cancer, such as certain current or former heavy smokers.

In stage IA, cancer has formed and may be up to 3 centimeters across. Cancer cells are only in the lung.    In stage IB, cancer is between 3 and 5 centimeters across, cancer is found in one part of the lung and has spread to the outer covering of the lung (the pleura), or there are cancer cells in fluid that has built up between the lung and the pleura.       Stage II    Stage II is divided into substages IIA and IIB.       In stage IIA, cancer is between 5 and 7 centimeters across.     In stage IIB, cancer is either:            - between 5 and 7 centimeters across and has spread to an nearby lymph node on the same side of the body as the cancer; or     - larger than 7 centimeters across; or     - cancer has formed in the main airway of the lung, near where it enters the lung; or     - cancer has spread to the pleura and the outer membrane of the heart or the diaphragm (the muscle under the lung that helps breathing) and may be any size; or     - cancer may be any size and has spread to certain nearby areas, including the chest wall (including the lining that covers the chest wall and the outer membrane of the heart or the diaphragm), the pericardium, the nerves that go to the heart, the main airway, one or more lobes of the lung, or the carina (the area where the lowest part of the main airway branches).

A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a radioactive substance called fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) is used instead of glucose. This procedure is also called positron emission tomography.    -    CT Scan (CAT Scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung and lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look for abnormal tissue or cancer cells in the lymph nodes between the lungs in the chest. An incision (cut) is made at the base of the neck and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. Tissue samples are removed through the mediastinoscope and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.     -   Thoracotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs and the chest is opened. Tissue samples may be taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.

Treatment for unresectable non-small cell lung cancer may also be based on whether the cancer is limited (located in one area) or extensive (has spread to other parts of the chest). The cancer may also be described as recurrent. Recurrent cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. It may come back to the lung or to other parts of the body.          Resectable non-small cell lung cancer    In resectable non-small cell lung cancer, the tumor can be removed by surgery. The cancer has not spread widely within the chest or to other parts of the body. Stages I, II, and IIIA include this type of cancer.       Unresectable non-small cell lung cancer     In unresectable non-small cell lung cancer, the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery. It may be inoperable or the patient may be too sick to have surgery. Most of the time, stage IIIB and IV non-small cell lung cancer are unresectable. Unresectable non-small cell lung cancer may also include some cancer that has recurred. Unresectable cancer may be limited or extensive:            - Limited non-small cell lung cancer may include one tumor, a group of tumors, or tumors that have spread through tissue and organs in the same area of the body.     - Extensive non-small cell lung cancer has spread widely through the lung, in the chest, between the lungs, or to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\\n                    In stage 0 (carcinoma in situ), abnormal cells are found in the innermost lining of the lung.

One of the following types of surgery may be done:            -  Wedge resection: The doctor removes the cancer or other abnormal tissue in the lung and some of the healthy lung tissue that surrounds it.      -  Segmental resection: The doctor removes the entire lung segment in which the cancer was found.     -  Lobectomy: The doctor removes the entire lobe of a lung where the cancer was found.     -  Pneumonectomy: The doctor removes an entire lung. Sometimes the doctor also removes a small part of the lining around the lung or some of the tissue between the lungs, including parts of the bronchi, larynx, or diaphragm.            Because lung cancer sometimes spreads into small lymph nodes near the lungs and also along the nerves going into the lungs, the doctor usually removes many lymph nodes from the chest at the time of surgery. This is called sampling or dissection of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. It is important for the doctor to remove the lymph nodes so the cancer can be staged correctly and the patient can be given the right treatment. In stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, when one cancer has spread to another cancer in the lungs, there will be at least one area of cancer left after surgery.       Surgery may be used to treat stage I, stage II, stage IIIA, and certain cases of stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.    Even if the doctor removes all visible cancer, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer.       Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment given twice a day, with a higher than usual total dose of radiation. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is a shortened radiation treatment schedule that gives a higher dose of radiation in each treatment and fewer treatments overall. Both hyperfractionated and hypofractionated radiation therapy are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer.     Radiation therapy may be used to treat stage I or stage II lung cancer in patients who are not able to have surgery. Special types of radiation therapy such as external low-dose-rate brachytherapy or radiosurgery may be used. Radiosurgery uses a special machine to aim one or more beams of radiation directly at the cancer. Radiosurgery can also be used to treat stage III or IV. Sometimes radiation therapy is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain or bones.           Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

Patients may receive one or more treatments. The treatment of non-small cell lung cancer will depend on several factors and is discussed below with treatment options. Detailed information about the treatment of each stage of non-small cell lung cancer and treatment of recurrent non-small cell lung cancer can be found in the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer section.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Choosing the most appropriate treatment for non-small cell lung cancer depends on the following:\\n                    Whether the cancer has spread from the lung to other parts of the body.        Non-small cell lung cancer that remains in the lung and does not spread has a better prognosis. Treatment is different for cancer that remains in the lung and cancer that spreads.           Whether the tumor in the lung is causing signs or symptoms.        Non-small cell lung cancer can block the airway and cause coughing, shortness of breath, and other problems. Sometimes treatment is needed to relieve these signs and symptoms.           Whether there are certain changes in the genes or chromosomes (gene mutations) that are linked to cancer.        In non-small cell lung cancer, genetic changes that lead to obesity, low body weight, and resistance to leptin (a hormone made in fat tissue to regulate appetite) may be linked to a change in how the cancer grows. Laboratory and clinical studies have found evidence to suggest that treatments that change leptin signaling could slow the growth of NSCLC in patients with the genetic changes mentioned above. Certain targeted treatment drugs such as etoposide, erlotinib, and gefitinib are available for the treatment of some previously treated patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. Other targeted therapies such as ALIMTA (pemetrexed) are approved as first-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC (without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations). See the Latest Research section for more information about the targeted therapies being studied to treat NSCLC.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Treatment for a called a platinum-based chemotherapy is often used.\\n                    Platinum-based chemotherapy is a drug or combination of drugs used to treat many types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer. A platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, contains the mineral platinum. It kills cancer cells by affecting the DNA of cancer cells and preventing them from dividing. Other chemotherapeutic drugs are added to the treatment regimen along with the platinum-drug and the combination is referred to as a \\\"regimen.\\\"    See the General Information About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment section of this summary for more information about types of treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials.

Surgery is the most common treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. One or more of the following types of surgery may be done to remove the cancer:              -  Lobectomy: Surgery to remove the entire lobe (large section) of a lung.     -  Pneumonectomy: Surgery to remove an entire lung.     -  Segmentectomy or wedge resection: Surgery to remove part of a lobe of a lung.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.

Radiation therapy may work in different ways, such as by causing cancer cells to die, so they can no longer grow or spread. It may be given before, during, or after surgery. It is also used to relieve the symptoms of advanced cancer, such as pain.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy may be given before radiation therapy or surgery. Treatment given before surgery or radiation therapy to shrink a tumor is called neoadjuvant therapy. It may also be given after surgery as adjuvant therapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.

It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Targeted therapies are becoming more common as initial treatment for advanced newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. Targeted therapies that are approved to treat patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer include gefitinib and erlotinib.     See Drugs Approved for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information.     Photodynamic therapy     Photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. A laser beam is then focused on the cancer cells, activating the drug, which kills the cells. Photodynamic therapy may be used as palliative treatment in some patients to relieve blockage in the airway caused by non-small cell lung cancer.

Countries use different staging systems to describe the spread of non-small cell lung cancer. The most commonly used systems are the TNM staging system and the SEER staging system. The treatment is based on the TNM stage. The SEER lung and bronchus cancer stages are listed below with the treatments used for the TNM stages that are grouped together to make the SEER stages.            -  Surgery and/or radiation therapy are used to treat stage I non-small cell lung cancer.       - Surgery and/or chemotherapy are used to treat stage II non-small cell lung cancer.      - Surgery, or surgery together with chemotherapy, are used to treat stage III non-small cell lung cancer. If the cancer is too far spread for surgery, treatment is with chemotherapy together with radiation therapy.       -  Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are used to treat stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.              Most patients have surgery to remove part of the lung. Before removing the tumor by surgery, the doctor must make sure that the tumor is confined to a part of the lung and the patient can live with part of the lung removed. Good ways to test these things are with a heart and lung function test and an exercise test, such as walking on a treadmill.       Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       For those whose cancer cannot be fully removed, such as those who might be too sick to have the cancer removed or those with a small tumor and poor heart or lung function, other treatments may help to relieve signs and symptoms of the disease.

Bronchoscopy is a type of external radiation therapy and is also used to open the airways that have been blocked by tumors. It may be done to relieve cough, trouble breathing, or bleeding.    External radiation therapy is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer in many ways:            -  Before surgery: Radiation therapy is sometimes given before surgery to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of healthy tissue that needs to be removed.     -  After surgery: More radiation therapy may be given to kill any cancer cells remaining in the area after surgery.    - To relieve symptoms: External radiation therapy may be given to shrink tumors that have spread and are blocking a main airway or pressing on nerves or blood vessels\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.    - Seven types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery      - Radiation therapy      - Chemotherapy      - Chemoradiation therapy      - Targeted therapy      - Immunotherapy      - Palliative/supportive care         - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - Hyperthermia therapy         - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Also see the PDQ summary on Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment for more information.         -  Wedge resection or segmental resection: Surgery to remove a small, wedge-shaped piece of the lung containing the tumor, including a margin (border) of healthy tissue around the tumor. Lymph nodes near the lung may also be removed and checked for cancer.  Sometimes this type of surgery is called a lung-sparing resection.     -  Lobectomy: Surgery to remove the entire lobe of a lung containing the tumor. Lymph nodes in the lung may also be removed and checked for cancer. If the tumor is near the middle of the chest or if the patient has other medical conditions, a lobectomy may not be able to be done. In some cases, a lobectomy can be done by video or with a thoracoscope.    -  Sleeve lobectomy: Surgery in which the chest is opened and the lung tumor is removed, along with a portion of the bronchus (windpipe). The remaining section of the bronchus is reattached to the main airway leading to the lungs.     -  Pneumonectomy: Surgery to remove an entire lung, including the lymph nodes in the lung.

There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid frame is used to keep the patient from moving during treatment. This allows a high dose of radiation to be given to the tumor and decreases the dose to the nearby normal tissue. It is given in 1 to 5 treatment sessions. Also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy is less likely to cause side effects such as esophagitis (inflammation or irritation of the esophagus) and pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs) than other ways of giving radiation therapy.       -  3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiation therapy: A type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-D picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a higher dose of radiation to reach the tumor with less radiation to nearby healthy tissue. The radiation dose may be increased over several days. This is called radiation dose calibration. It is not yet known if radiation dose calibration is better than standard radiation therapy for NSCLC.       -  Proton-beam radiation therapy is a type of\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage cancer are usually done at the same time.       The following tests and procedures may be used in the diagnosis and staging of small cell lung cancer:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as certain proteins and enzymes, released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as through the brain, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -  PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.    -   Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. The sample of fluid is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.     -  Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.     -  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is taken during surgery or by needle. A biopsy of the tissue in the tumor is needed to diagnose small cell lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    For small cell lung cancer, there are two stages.\\n                    Many patients with small cell lung cancer have extensive disease when they are diagnosed.

In addition, treatments used to stop cancer from growing may also stop healthy cells from growing and dividing. This may cause unwanted side effects, such as infertility in women of childbearing age and in men. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about who should be on your child's health care team before treatment begins. At this time,kind of follow-up care is needed after treatment, too.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Five types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on whether it is first-line, second-line, or third-line chemotherapy. See the General Introduction to Lung Cancer for more information.   Second-line chemotherapy is used when a first-line chemotherapy treatment has been tried and is ineffective, has stopped working, or has caused intolerable side effects. Sometimes second-line chemotherapy works even if the first-line treatment did not work. The doctor will continue to check the patient carefully so that the first sign of the tumor growing can be detected. People who have had a complete or partial response to first-line chemotherapy that lasts for more than 3 months also may be treated at the time of tumor progression (growth or spread) with the same drugs they took in first line. This is called re-treatment.     Third-line chemotherapy is used when both the first-line and second-line chemotherapy treatments have been tried and are ineffective, have stopped working, or have caused intolerable side effects. The doctor will continue to check the patient carefully so that the first sign of the tumor growing can be detected.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether it is external or internal. External radiation therapy to the brain may also be called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).      Radiation therapy may work in different ways. Some patients have radiation therapy alone. Others have it with chemotherapy before surgery. For example, combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy before surgery to remove a tumor is called neoadjuvant therapy. It may kill any cancer cells that have spread and make the tumor smaller. Other patients may have surgery first, and then have radiation therapy to any lymph nodes that are not removed by surgery. For radiation therapy to work well, it is important that patients receive all the radiation treatments for which they are scheduled. Treatment is usually once a day for 3 weeks.       Surgery    Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is an option for some patients with very small tumors. Tissue and cells that are removed during an operation are then viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to see whether there are cancer cells in the tissue or to see whether all of the cancer that can be seen\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer.    - Three types of standard treatment are used:         -  Chemotherapy     -  Surgery      -  Radiation therapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.     -  Immunotherapy        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Some treatments may cause side effects.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with small cell lung cancer.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.     Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be treated with the new treatment. Most clinical trials compare a new treatment to a standard treatment. Some clinical trials also compare a new treatment to a placebo (a substance that has no treatment value).        During treatment, a patient may have tests to see how well the treatment is working. Treatment will be stopped if it is not working or is causing harmful side effects.    Systemic and local treatments are used. Systemic treatment is delivered through the bloodstream to reach cells all over the body. Local treatment is directed at a tumor and small areas around it.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body, and whether it has spread to other places in the body.     See Drugs Approved for Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information.       Surgery      Surgery is a procedure to remove lung tissue containing cancer. Bright light and special instruments may be used to look inside the chest for abnormal areas.    Types of surgery include the following:            -  Lobectomy with lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the entire lobe of a lung is removed. A lobectomy can be done using a video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approach through one small incision and several tiny incisions or a thoracotomy, which is an incision (cut) between two ribs. When VATS is used, surgical instruments and a tiny video camera attached to a thin, lighted tube are inserted through the incisions. A thoracotomy is most commonly done. The lymph nodes in the chest are also removed. This is called a lobectomy with lymph node dissection.     -  Pneumonectomy with lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which an entire lung is removed and the lymph nodes in the chest are removed.     -  Sleeve lobectomy with lymph node dissection:  A surgical procedure in which one entire lobe (a section) of a lung is removed through a thoracotomy (incision between two ribs) along with the lymph nodes in the chest. The part of the bronchus (airway) leading to the lobe is removed and the remaining ends of the bronchus are joined together.               Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer.    External radiation therapy to the brain may be given for two reasons:            -  To treat cancer that has spread to the brain    -  To prevent cancer from spreading to the brain. When cancer has spread to the brain, it is called brain metastases.           Radiation therapy to prevent brain metastases may be called prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI).    Radiation therapies are given after certain types of cancer treatment for small cell lung cancer.       New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer.    - Five types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery      - Radiation therapy     - Chemotherapy     - Chemoradiation      - Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with small cell lung cancer.

Surgery is used to treat very small tumors, rarely in patients with small cell lung cancer. When used, surgery may include the following procedures:            -  Wedge resection: A wedge-shaped piece of lung that contains the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it is removed.      -  Lobectomy: The removal of an entire lobe (section) of one lung. A wedge resection or segmental resection of a lung is also a lobectomy.      -  Pneumonectomy: The removal of an entire lung.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.      Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These procedures include the following:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT): SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy. Special x-ray machines are used to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor in a small number of treatments. This procedure is also called stereotaxic body radiation therapy, stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy, and stereotaxic radiation therapy.        -  Stereotactic radiosurgery: A type of external radiation therapy that uses a rigid head frame to keep the patients head still while a large dose of radiation is aimed directly at the tumor being treated. This procedure is also called radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiation therapy.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer that has not spread widely throughout the lung and to treat cancer that has come back in the chest.    Radiation therapy may work better in patients who are not active smokers during treatment.    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).  The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.      Chemoradiation      Chemoradiation is a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. For example, chemoradiation may be used as a lung-sparing, stage-limiting treatment for patients with limited small cell lung cancer who are not able to have surgery.       Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)        Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is radiation therapy to the head to kill small groups of cancer cells that may have spread to the brain but cannot be seen on an x-ray, CT scan, or MRI.

Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Chemotherapy has been used to treat prophylaxis small cell lung cancer.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and whether treatment is given to cure the cancer or to relieve symptoms caused by the cancer (palliative radiation therapy).           -  External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer.     -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT or SAbR) is another type of external radiation therapy. It uses special equipment to place the patient in the same position for each treatment. SBRT may be given in fewer high-dose treatments than external radiation therapy.        Chemoradiation therapy    Chemoradiation therapy is a cancer treatment that combines chemotherapy with radiation therapy. The chemotherapy drugs make the cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy than they would be if radiation therapy were given alone, so that both treatments kill more cancer cells.        Prophylactic cranial radiation therapy     Even when small cell lung cancer seems to have been cured, it may spread to the brain. Prophylactic cranial radiation therapy is radiation therapy given to the brain when there are no signs the cancer has spread there. The treatment is given to prevent cancer from spreading to the brain.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Hyperthermia therapy     Hyperthermia therapy is a treatment in which body tissue is heated above the normal temperature, sometimes up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Research has shown that certain anticancer drugs work better when heated. Hyperthermia therapy is usually given with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

In most cases, cancer cells form a tumor. A tumor can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren\u00c2\u2019t cancer while malignant tumors are cancer. When cancer cells break away from a tumor, they can travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or through the lymph system and form new tumors far from the original tumor.

It is an aggressive form of lung cancer that is linked to cigarette smoking. Early in its development, the cancer cells break away from the tumor and travel through the bloodstream. The spread of cancer to other parts of the body often happens before the cancer has been found.

Lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung. The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs inside the chest. The lungs are made of different types of cells. Lung cancer begins in the lungs but can spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain. There are two main types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer is further divided into squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.    One of the most important keys to treating lung cancer is early detection. Lung cancer screening may help detect lung cancer at an early stage in some people. Lung cancer screening is a way to find cancer before there are signs or symptoms. The screening test for lung cancer is a low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scan. A low-dose spiral CT scan is a safe and painless test that takes a picture of the inside of the lungs.

If you smoke, your risk of lung cancer is 10 to 20 times higher than that of nonsmokers. It is important not to smoke or use other types of tobacco. If you already smoke, quitting is the best way to lower your risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer risk decreases over time in former smokers.     Millions of Americans have stopped smoking, and rates of lung cancer have dropped in men in the United States. Lung cancer rates have also dropped in women born in the 1930s and 1940s, because fewer women in these groups smoked.

The mutations tell the cell to grow out of control and not to die. The abnormal cells form a tumor. The cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and break away from the tumor to spread (metastasize) to other places in the body.

When a pregnant woman smokes, the baby she is carrying may also have an increased risk of lung cancer later in life.    Other types of smoke that can raise your risk of lung cancer include smoke from a fireplace, wood stove, or burning wood, coal, or coke; smoke from cooking with coal or wood without good air flow; hookah (water pipe) smoke; and secondhand smoke, which is the smoke given off by a burning tobacco product and the smoke exhaled by a person smoking.

Small cell lung cancer is named for how the cancer cells look under a microscope. Small cell lung cancer is more aggressive than all types of non-small cell lung cancer.

The more cigarettes a person smokes per day and the longer a person has smoked, the greater their risk of lung cancer.

Three types of screening are being studied to detect lung cancer early:        - Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    - Low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scan: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the chest, such as the lungs, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A low-dose helical CT scan uses a lower amount of radiation than a regular CT scan. Also called spiral CT and CAT scan.    - Sputum cytology: The study of sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) under a microscope to check for cancer cells.       These tumor markers and screening tests have not been found to reduce the chance of dying from lung cancer. They are not recommended for lung cancer screening at this time except for a CT scan for people who have a high risk of lung cancer because of smoking history (see Prevention).\\n                \\n                \\n                    Tests that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage lung cancer.\\n                    The following tests and procedures may be used: FNA biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.

The most common causes of lung cancer include:         -  Having a personal history of lung disease.    -  Smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes.    -  Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke.    -  Having a lower intake of fruits and vegetables.    -  Being exposed to certain substances.         Certain lung diseases can increase the risk of lung cancer. Patients who have COPD have an increased risk of lung cancer. A personal history of tuberculosis also increases the risk of lung cancer.    Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. When tobacco burns, it releases chemicals that damage DNA. The more a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer. People who have smoked are at higher risk for lung cancer even years after quitting.    Children of women who smoked while pregnant were found to be at increased risk for tobacco-related cancers such as lung cancer.    Secondhand tobacco smoke causes cancer in nonsmokers.

Endocrine glands make hormones and other substances that are released into the blood and affect other parts of the body. Parathyroid cancer forms in one or more of the four parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are part of the endocrine system.   There are four parathyroid glands that are located around the outer part of the thyroid gland, which is in the lower part of the front of the neck. The parathyroid glands are not the same as the thyroid gland, and the diseases of the parathyroid glands are different from disorders of the thyroid. Sometimes there may be 5 to 8 parathyroid glands, or fewer than 4.   Parathyroid glands control the amount of calcium in the blood and bones and release parathyroid hormone through the blood. Bone cells have receptors for this hormone. The hormone tells the bone cells to release calcium from the bones into the blood when the level of calcium in the blood is too low. The hormone also tells the kidneys to release calcium into the urine (pee), tell the intestines to take calcium from food, and tell the bones to take calcium from the blood.     Hyperparathyroidism is a disorder caused by increased levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood. It is usually caused by a parathyroid adenoma (a parathyroid tumor that is not cancer) but can also be caused by parathyroid cancer. When there is too much parathyroid hormone, too much calcium is released from the bones into the blood and the bones have less calcium than they need. Too much calcium is also released by the kidneys into the urine and taken from the intestines. High levels of calcium in the blood may cause kidney stones. Parathyroid cancer is the cause of about 1 percent of all cases of hyperparathyroidism. This summary is about parathyroid cancer.

A small number of patients who have parathyroid cancer also have certain inherited (passed from parents to child) disorders, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or 2B (MEN2 or MEN2B) syndrome. Many cases, however, occur in people with no family history of these inherited disorders.

A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. A sample of bone tissue is removed during a bone biopsy. An imaging biopsy-guided may be used to watch the needle for a biopsy through the use of ultrasound, a CT scan, or other imaging. Because parathyroid cancer is often hard to diagnose without checking tissue under a microscope, surgery often is done to see if the tumor can be removed.    -   Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of cells from a tumor (lump) using a thin needle. A pathologist views the cells under a microscope to look for cancer cells.   -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. These tests may include the following:               -  Serum calcium test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of calcium in the blood.     -  Serum parathyroid hormone test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The parathyroid hormone regulates the amount of calcium in the blood by controlling the movement of calcium into and out of bones and the absorption of calcium from the intestines and kidneys.     -  Serum phosphate test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of phosphate in the blood. PTH lowers the level of phosphate in the blood. Parathyroid cancer may increase PTH and, therefore, lower phosphate levels.    -  Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the level of vitamin D. Parathyroid cancer may lower it.    -  Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the level of vitamin D. Parathyroid cancer may lower it.              -   Protein immunoassay : A test used to check the blood for protein markers (Cancer antigen 15-3 [CA 15-3], alpha fetoprotein [AFP], CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], calcitonin, and thyroglobulin).  High levels of these tumor markers in the blood sometimes are a sign of certain cancers. These markers cannot tell for sure that cancer is in the body. Other tests are needed to tell if cancer cells are present.   -   Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.  The urine is checked to see if there is extra calcium.     -   Bone mineral density test (BMD test): A procedure that measures the amount of calcium and other types of minerals in an area of bone. A special x-ray is used to check the amount of minerals in bone.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.

These markers are used to see how well treatment is working in patients with a known tumor.   -   24-hour urine chemistry studies : A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the urine by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. The samples of urine will be checked for the level of the substances shown below.     - Creatinine: This test is used to show how well the kidney is working.    -  Calcium: Calcium is usually found in small amounts in urine. A high level of calcium in the urine can be a sign of parathyroid cancer.    -  Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP): The level of cAMP in the urine is measured. cAMP is a compound found in cells that is related to the action of PTH. A high level of PTH may cause an increase in cAMP in the urine.    - Metanephrines: The level of metanephrines in the urine is measured. Metanephrines are made from epinephrine and norepinephrine in the body and in the laboratory. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are hormones made by the adrenal glands. A high level of metanephrines may be a sign of a tumor in the adrenal gland.   -   Sestamibi parathyroid scan : A procedure used to measure the function of the parathyroid glands. A small amount of a radioactive substance called sestamibi is injected into a vein in the arm. The sestamibii travels through the bloodstream to the parathyroid glands. A scanner detects the radiation given off by the sestamibi and makes a picture of the parathyroid glands.

The results of diagnostic and staging tests are combined to find out the size of the tumor and where it is when it first spreads.

This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Sestamibi scan : A procedure to find parathyroid cancer. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material is taken up (absorbed) by overactive parathyroid tissue and areas where cancer cells are growing.

For treatment of parathyroid cancer, doctors will know if the cancer is untreated, locally invasive, or metastatic. There is no standard system for staging parathyroid cancer.   Untreated parathyroid cancer means that the cancer has not been treated other than for symptoms such as bone pain.    Locally invasive parathyroid cancer is cancer that has grown beyond the parathyroid gland and into nearby tissues.   Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the primary (original) tumor to other parts of the body. The spread of cancer can be through tissue, the lymph system, or the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.    - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.    - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.        Sometimes the tumor may spread from the parathyroid gland to other parts of the neck. Cancer that has spread from the parathyroid gland to distant parts of the body, such as the bone or lung, is known as metastatic parathyroid cancer.

There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - Lymphatic spread (or lymphogenous spread) occurs when cancer cells invade the lymph system and travel through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.    - Hematogenous spread (or hematogenous metastasis) occurs when cancer cells invade the veins or capillaries and travel through the bloodstream to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There is no standard staging system for parathyroid cancer.\\n                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages.

Staging of parathyroid cancer is usually done as soon as possible after the cancer is diagnosed. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of certain blood tests and imaging tests may be used to find out how far the cancer has spread. Imaging tests use x-rays, sound waves, magnetic fields, or radioactive particles to create pictures of the inside of the body. The procedures used to diagnose or stage parathyroid cancer are the same as those used to find out if the cancer has recurred (come back). They include the following:         -  Ultrasound exam: A diagnostic procedure that uses high-energy sound waves to bounce off internal tissues or organs including the parathyroids and is used to make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. An ultrasound exam may be done to check for signs of cancer in the thyroid or parathyroids.    -  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the bone and chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the bone and chest. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -  Sestamibi scan: A procedure to take a picture of the thyroid or parathyroid glands. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein, and a special camera is used to take a picture of the radiation in the neck area as the substance collects in the thyroid or parathyroid glands. This procedure is also called parathyroid scintigraphy, radionuclide scanning, or thyroid scan. A movement disorder such as Parkinson disease or Huntington chorea may make it hard to get a clear picture, so another procedure may be done instead.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if parathyroid cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually parathyroid cancer cells.

It usually recurs (comes back) locally after treatment and does not spread to other parts of the body. When the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it cannot be cured. Treatment is given to control the growth of the cancer and ease symptoms caused by the cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery      Surgery to remove the tumor is usually used to treat parathyroid cancer. One or more parathyroid glands and nearby tissue may be removed. The surgeon also checks other organs in the neck for signs that the cancer has spread. If the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, these lymph nodes may also be removed. If the patient has too much parathyroid hormone in the blood (hyperparathyroidism), this may be eased by removing the tumor.         Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat parathyroid cancer.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Treatment of parathyroid cancer may include the use of a radioactive isotope of carbon called carbon-14, or C-14.    One or more chemotherapy drugs may be given by mouth or by vein to treat parathyroid cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    When cancer has recurred (come back), treatment options depend on where the cancer recurred or spread.\\n                    Treatment of parathyroid cancer that has recurred after the original treatment is given for cure or relief of symptoms. The cancer may recur locally, regionally or distantly.    If a tumor that is causing hyperparathyroidism (too much parathyroid hormone in the blood) recurs in the neck, it is usually treated with surgery. If the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery, calcimimetic therapy (drugs that lower the level of calcium in the blood) can help lower a high calcium level (hypercalcemia) that occurs when there is too much parathyroid hormone in the blood.    If the cancer has recurred in other parts of the body and cannot be cured, treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.

Lymph nodes near the thyroid gland may also be removed. Patients with one parathyroid gland with cancer will usually have both parathyroid glands and the thyroid gland removed. They will need to take medicine for the rest of their life to replace hormones usually made by the parathyroid glands and thyroid. See Drugs Approved for Parathyroid Cancer for more information.         Radiation therapy to bone      Even when the main cancer can be taken out by surgery, there may be little change in survival time for patients with parathyroid cancer. Since this disease is rare and there have not been many studies, the best treatment for parathyroid cancer is not known. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, treatment may help prevent the cancer from coming back and help manage the signs and symptoms caused by the cancer.         Drug therapy     Bisphosphonate therapy (drug treatment) may be used when high levels of calcium in the blood cannot be controlled by hydration, diuretics, or mobilization. It may also be used before surgery to access the bones of the patient. Once the patient is in surgery bisphosphonate treatment may continue for to 6 weeks after decrease the amount of parathyroid hormone and help to slowly decrease the calcium levels of the patient.

During parathyroidectomy, the surgeon may remove only one parathyroid gland (called a limited or focused parathyroidectomy), or more than one gland may be removed. There are two types of parathyroidectomy. One type, called a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, is used if only one parathyroid gland is affected. The other type used is a bilateral neck exploration. The surgeon will check all the parathyroid glands and remove any that are enlarged or overactive. The surgeon may check all four glands to make sure that at least one of them remains after the surgery.\\\"   -  Thyroidectomy: Surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland.

There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT): A type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to keep the patient's body still and to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor. It is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): An external radiation therapy that uses a computer to move the radiation beams around the body in a three-dimensional pattern.       -  Proton therapy:  A type of high-dose, high-energy, cyclotron-generated, external radiation therapy that uses protons rather than x-rays to treat cancer. The protons damage cancer cells in the tumor. This procedure is being used to treat some types of cancer, and is being studied in the treatment of other cancers.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.

Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:           -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and whether you have surgery. External radiation therapy is being studied in the treatment of parathyroid cancer.        Chemoembolization and cryoablation     Chemoembolization and cryoablation are non-surgical ways of treating cancer.       -  Chemoembolization: A small incision (cut) is made in, or near, the groin and a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into the main artery (blood vessel) that runs through the body. The tip of the catheter is guided to the liver and a cancer-killing drug is injected into the blood vessels feeding the tumor. Small particles are also injected to block the blood flow (embolization).    -  Cryoablation: Liquid nitrogen or argon gas is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. A thin, wand-like needle (cryoprobe) is inserted through the skin and into the tumor to freeze the tissue around it. This causes an \\\"ice ball\\\" to form, killing the cells. A computer monitors the temperature at the tip of the cryoprobe and the size of the ice ball.     If there is cancer left after treatment, or if the cancer recurs (comes back), parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be high, even if the calcium level in the blood returns to normal. This section of the summary is about treating high PTH levels. Treatment may include one or more of the following:            -  PTH-lowering drugs to lower PTH levels.    -  Internal radiation therapy to kill the cancer cells.    -  Cryoablation to freeze and kill the cancer cells.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

It also helps make urine (pee). The average size of a flaccid penis is 3 inches. Most penises grow to about 5 to 7 inches when they become hard. When the penis becomes hard (erect), blood flows quickly into it and is trapped there.     Acts of sex usually cause the penis to become erect. The urethra runs through the center of the penis from the bladder to the top of the penis. Sperm and urine leave the body through the urethra.     Penile cancer can form in the skin or in the tissues underneath the skin of the penis. The most common type of penile cancer starts in the skin cells of the penis. As it grows, it can move into nearby tissue and to other parts of the body.    The pictures below show the parts of the penis in a normal penis and in a penis with cancer.

The shaft is the long part of the penis. The tip of the penis is called the glans. Under the glans is a loose fold of skin called the foreskin. The foreskin can stretch to cover the outside of the glans. Most boys have their foreskin pulled back (retracted) during their first few years. There is a surgical procedure called circumcision in which the foreskin is cut off. After being circumcised, the skin around the penile head continues to grow, and the penile head becomes dry and hard like the skin on the shaft.     The penis has three columns of tissue made of spongy material. In this material are blood vessels that fill with blood during an erection. Two of the columns run along the top of the penis. They are called the corpora cavernosa. The third column surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body) and is called the corpus spongiosum.         Penile cancer forms in the skin or in the tissues underneath the skin on the penis.     Most penile cancers form in cells in the inner part of the foreskin and on the glans. Treatment of these cancers may include surgery to take off part or all of the penis. This can make it hard for a man to have sex or to pass urine in a standing position. There are treatments that lower the chance that the cancer will return while still allowing the patient to urinate standing up and have sex.    Penile cancer is rare.

This blood flow causes the penis to become larger and stiff (erect). At the end of the penis is a layer of tissue called the glans. The foreskin is a loose layer of skin that covers and protects the glans. The opening of the urethra, the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body, is at the tip of the glans.      Cancer that forms in the penis most often forms in skin cells, but may also form in connective tissues and lymph nodes. Cancer can also spread to the penis from other parts of the body.

A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    - Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Different types of biopsies may be done, depending on the area being checked:               -  Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn t look normal.        -  Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn t look normal. For penile cancer, the whole tumor and some surrounding tissue are removed.            A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done to see if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the tumor. This is done by injecting a substance that can be seen on x-ray or by a Geiger counter or dye into the tumor. The substance travels to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance is removed. If the cancer has spread, it may have spread to this lymph node. If cancer cells are found, more lymph nodes may be removed.

(See the General Information section).\\n                \\n                \\n                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging.\\n                    The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following stages are used for penile cancer:\\n                    Stage 0 (Penile carcinoma in situ)    In stage 0, the tumor is found only in the outer layer of skin.      Stage I     In stage I, the tumor:             - is found under the top layer of skin only; or     - has grown into the connective tissue under the skin.           No cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes in the groin.      Stage II     In stage II, the tumor:            - has grown into the structures under the skin. These structures may be the corpus spongiosum (tissue that helps with erection and helps keep the urethra open) or the corpora cavernosa (pair of spongy tissues found in the penis that fill with blood during an erection); or     - has grown into the urethra (the tube through which urine passes through the penis) and the corpora cavernosa.           No cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes in the groin.       Stage III    Stage III is divided into stage IIIA and stage IIIB:            - Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread into the urethra (the tube through which urine passes through the penis) and/or the anus and the corpora cavernosa (pair of spongy tissues found in the penis that fill with blood during an erection). Cancer cells are found in one to two lymph nodes in the groin. Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may be between the lymph nodes or in vessels near the lymph nodes.    - Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the corpus spongiosum (tissue that helps with erection and helps keep the urethra open), corpora cavernosa, and/or urethra (the tube through which urine passes through the penis). Cancer cells are found in one to two lymph nodes in the groin. Lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may be between the lymph nodes or in vessels near the lymph nodes. Cancer has caused a blockage that prevents urine from passing out of the body, or the cancer has spread to the skin around the external opening of the urethra.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for penile cancer:         - Stage 0     - Stage I      - Stage II     - Stage IIIA     - Stage IIIB     - Stage IV\\n                \\n                \\n                    After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.\\n                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging.

Stage I     In stage I, cancer has spread into tissue below the top layer of skin of the inner foreskin, outer foreskin, or tip of the penis. The growth is not larger than 2 centimeters (cm). Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.       Stage II     In stage II, cancer has spread into the corpus spongiosum (spongy tissue surrounding the urethra) or corpora cavernosa (two spongy bodies in the penis that become engorged with blood and stiffen during an erection). The growth may be any size. Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.        Stage IIIA    In stage IIIA, cancer has spread into a single lymph node in the groin that is 5 cm or smaller or has spread to one or more lymph nodes in the groin that are 5 cm or smaller and cancer has reached the corpora cavernosa and/or urethra or cancer is a stage I or II tumor that has spread at least to the corpus spongiosum and/or corpora cavernosa or cancer has broken through the skin of the penis.       Stage IIIB     In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes in the groin that are larger than 5 cm. Cancer may have spread to the corpus spongiosum and/or corpora cavernosa, urethra, or broken through the skin of the penis.       Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes near the pelvis and/or to other parts of the body. Cancer may also have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin.     The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is also used to stage penile cancer. This system is based on three key pieces of information:         - The size of the tumor and whether it has spread from where it first formed to nearby areas (tumor).    - Whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes (nodes).    - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis).

The results of the tests are used to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.      -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).      -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread.\\n                    The process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging.

Stage 0p Stage 0 is divided into stages 0a and 0p. Stage 0p includes abnormal cells in the epithelium only, which have changed the way they look under a microscope.        Stage 0a       - In stage 0a, abnormal cells:              - have not grown deep into the epithelium, and have a slightly increased risk of becoming invasive cancer, or       - are spread over a larger area than in stage 0p and have a slightly increased risk of becoming invasive cancer.               - Stage 0a may be called high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.    In stage 0a lesions can be squamous cell carcinoma in situ or may show squamous cell carcinoma in situ features in association with atypical cells within the epithelium.       Stage 0b    In stage 0b there is superficial carcinoma in situ that has one or both of the following features:             - Invasion of tissue below the epithelium, or      - A high risk of spreading and becoming invasive cancer.         Stage I       - In stage I tumors have spread to the subepithelial connective tissue.        Stage II       - In stage II tumors have spread into one of the following tissues:             - The corpus spongiosum, which contains the urethra (the tube that carries urine).      - The corpus cavernosum, which is erectile tissue that fills with blood during an erection.

Stage IV        - In stage IV, tumors have spread:             - deeply into the shaft of the penis;      - into the prostate, scrotum, pelvic floor muscles, or pubic bone; or      - to a lymph node in the groin and one or more lymph nodes in the iliac, pelvic, or groin region.             - In stage IV tumors may have spread (metastasized) to distant parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The results of the tests are used to make the following three groups:\\n                    Penile cancer may be grouped into three categories:     Non-metastatic cancer Non-metastatic cancer is cancer that has not spread from the primary site (the place where it began) to other parts of the body. Non-metastatic penile cancer is found in the skin of the penis and nearby tissues.     Regional metastatic cancer Regional metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the primary site (the place where it began) to nearby areas.

Certain treatments are more common for certain stages of cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery    Surgery may include the following:              -  Mohs microsurgical technique: A surgical method of treating cancer by cutting layers of tissue and viewing them under a microscope until no abnormal cells remain.     -  Circumcision: Surgical removal of the foreskin.     -  Partial penectomy: Surgery in which part of the penis is removed.     -  Total penectomy: Surgery in which all of the penis is removed.     - Wide local excision: Surgery in which the tumor, lymph nodes, and a margin of healthy tissue around the tumor are removed. For cancer of the foreskin, this may include circumcision or partial penectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of three-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation that have different amounts of energy are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy can keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue.       -  Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy in which radioactive seeds are placed in the body near the cancer.           Radiation therapy to treat penile cancer may include the following:             -  Brachytherapy       - Stereotactic body radiation therapy: A type of external radiation therapy that uses a rigid frame to keep the body from moving to aim radiation at the tumor and decrease damage to healthy tissue. This procedure is done on an outpatient basis. This method of delivering radiation allows a higher dosage of radiation to be given to the tumor site. It also causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Medicine may be given to make the patient relax before this procedure.       -  External radiation therapy.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy and brachytherapy are used to treat penile cancer.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.

Before surgery, the male patient is given medicine that affects the brain and changes the patient\u2019s awareness of pain. These medicines are called anesthetics. Anesthesia can make a patient unaware of what is happening during surgery and/or make the patient not feel any pain. There are different types of surgery that may be used, depending on how far the cancer has spread:            -  Circumcision : A minor surgical procedure in which the foreskin is removed from the penis.    -  Penectomy : Surgery in which the whole penis and possibly the lymph nodes are removed. Partial penectomy is when only the end, or tip, of the penis is removed.     -  Mohs\u2019 surgery: A surgical technique that removes the cancer, blood vessel, and one layer of tissue at a time, until no cancer cells remain. This procedure leaves as much normal tissue as possible.     -  Lymphadenectomy : Surgery to remove lymph nodes. This procedure is also called lymph node dissection.         Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer, depending on where the cancer has spread. Internal radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in patients who have advanced penile cancer.

When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy may include the following:            - Intravesical chemotherapy: A treatment that places a chemotherapy drug, such as mitomycin, into the bladder to kill cancer cells. When used to treat penile cancer, the mixture of the chemotherapy drug and fluid is placed on the surface of the penis and urethra to kill cancer cells. This procedure is also called intravesical therapy.    - Neoadjuvant (before surgery) or adjuvant (after surgery) chemotherapy: Chemotherapy that is given before or after surgery to remove the tumor.    - Multimodality chemotherapy: A combination of treatments, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Photodynamic therapy     Photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug or medicine called a photosensitizing agent is injected into the blood, where it is absorbed by cells all over the body. The drug is absorbed more by cancer cells than by normal cells\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with penile cancer.     - Three types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery      - Radiation therapy      - Chemotherapy          - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.          - Photodynamic therapy     - Topical therapy     - Immunotherapy         - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with penile cancer.\\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with penile cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the treatment usually given now, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages of penile cancer.     Surgery for cancer that has not spread past the inner layer of tissue where it started may include the following:           - Wide local excision. Surgery to remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. This type of surgery may be done on tumors that are in the foreskin, the head of the penis, or the shaft of the penis.    - Circumcision. Surgery to remove skin attachments, such as the foreskin of the penis. Circumcision may be done before or after wide local excision.      - Mohs surgery. A procedure in which thin layers of cancer-containing skin are progressively removed and examined until only cancer-free tissue remains. This method is often used to save healthy skin on the head of the penis.    - Laser surgery. Surgery in which a laser beam is used to remove cancer tissue. This type of surgery can save healthy tissue on the head of the penis.              Surgery for invasive cancer may include the following:           - Partial or total penectomy. Surgery to remove part or all of the penis, down to the pubic bone. If patients have to go home without a penis, they need to learn how to cathetrize the urine from the bladder. This is called urethral catheterization. Whether they are taught how to do this before or after surgery depends on when the patient can urinate by him or herself through the new urethral opening. An operation to transplant tissue to reconstruct (rebuild) the penis may be done at the same time as the penectomy or in order to do this later.     - Exenteration. Surgery to remove all of the external genital organs, the surrounding skin, and any cancer that has spread along the pudendal nerves. Exenteration is sometimes done when the cancer has spread beyond the penis.     - Lymph node dissection. Surgery to remove lymph nodes in the groin. Sometimes this is done even when there are no enlarged lymph nodes as a way of preventing the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. This surgery may be used when the tumor is larger in size, is high grade, or spreads into tissues under the skin or into the body of the penis. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, a second surgery to remove lymph nodes may be done. This is called a \\\"completion lymphadenectomy.\\\"              Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat penile cancer.    External radiation therapy to the penis may be used to keep the cancer from growing and to save as much of the body and its functions as possible.

It is the most common treatment of local penile cancer. The doctor will try to remove all the cancer without removing too much healthy tissue. Because the top of the penis may be removed, a urethrostomy may be done at the same time to make a new opening for the urethra on the underside of the penis or in the perineum. The perineum is the area between the scrotum and the anus. This opening will help urine pass out of the body. This is a very sensitive topic and the patient may want to discuss this aspect of the treatment with his doctor.  Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. See the PDQ summary on Penile Cancer Treatment Overview for more information.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer. External radiation therapy may benefit patients with cancer of the urethra that has spread to the tissues surrounding the urethra because it may help save the penis.

Laser therapy    Sentinel lymph node biopsy         -  Lymph nodes  are tissues and organs that contain infection-fighting cells (such as lymphocytes). The cells in the lymph nodes help fight infections by attacking and destroying germs that are carried in through the lymph fluid.     - The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a procedure in which the sentinel lymph node(s) is removed and examined to determine whether cancer cells are present. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

The type of surgery used depends on the size of the cancer and where the cancer formed in the penis. If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, surgery may also include a lymphadenectomy, which is the removal of lymph nodes in order to remove cancer that has spread. A skin graft may be used where skin has been removed.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a rigid frame to keep the body still and a machine to aim radiation directly at the cancer. A total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over a period of several days. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is sometimes used to treat stage I cancer.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.            - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. It is different from other types of internal radiation therapy that use catheters or seeds that give off radiation for many days and are then taken out. Internal radiation therapy may be used to treat stage I cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.

Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.       Monoclonal antibody treatment is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to the cancer cells.

The signs and symptoms caused by the extra hormone are as follows:        - In women, higher than normal amounts of prolactin cause vaginal dryness and a decrease in libido. Women may stop having menstrual periods and may produce breast milk without being pregnant or nursing.    - In men, higher than normal amounts of prolactin cause a decrease in libido, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia (enlargement of the breasts).       Other functional pituitary tumors include gonadotrophinomas, thyrotropinomas, and non-secretory tumor cells secrete some hormone that does not cause any signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms of a nonfunctional tumor are caused by the tumor as it grows and presses on surrounding tissues. A nonfunctional tumor may press on the pituitary and cause other hormones made by the pituitary to be lower than normal.      - Nonfunctional gonadotrophinomas affect how the body makes male and female hormones.

A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   Visual acuity and visual field tests : Procedures that check vision and the ability to see objects peripherally (out of the corner of the eye).    -   Immunoassay : A laboratory test that measures the presence or amount of a substance in a solution using the reaction of an antibody or antibodies to its antigen. An example is to check blood hormone levels.    -   Endocrine testing : A test that measures how well the various hormone-secreting glands of the body are working. It also measures the level of hormones in blood or urine.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as sodium and potassium, which are given off by organs and tissues and are usually released into the bloodstream. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Serum prolactin test : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is secreted by the pituitary gland and causes milk to form in the breasts. Unusually high levels of prolactin can be a sign of a tumor that increases prolactin secretion (prolactinomas), or of other types of prolactin-secreting tumors that are not in the pituitary.    -   Serum insulin-like growth factor test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of the hormone insulin-like growth factor (IGF1). IGF1 is secreted by the pituitary gland and controls body growth. Unusually high levels of IGF1 can be a sign of a tumor that increases IGF1 secretion, or of other types of IGF1-secreting tumors that are not in the pituitary.    -   Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis: A procedure in which a sample of CSF is removed from the spinal column by a lumbar puncture and checked for disease and other abnormalities.

Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. Spread of cancer can occur by direct or indirect means.    - Direct spread. When cancer spreads from where it began to nearby tissue or organs, it is called direct spread.    - Indirect spread. When cancer spreads from where it began to distant parts of the body, it is called metastasis.    - Through the lymph system.

Functioning pituitary tumors are named by the hormone that the tumor makes in excess:         - Prolactin (lactogenic hormone).    -  Growth hormone.    -  Corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone).    -  Thyroid-stimulating hormone.    -  Gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone).        Pituitary tumors are described as a microadenoma if it is smaller than 10 mm and a macroadenoma if it is larger than 10 mm. The pituitary gland and the area surrounding it is shown in the image below.         The tumor may also be described by the glands or organs it affects or by the disease it causes. For example, a tumor that affects the adrenal glands and causes Cushing syndrome may be called a corticotroph adenoma.

It helps determine the kind of treatment needed. The information gathered from the staging process is used to plan treatment. For pituitary tumors, the stage is based on whether the tumor made of cancer cells.   There is no standard system for staging pituitary tumors. However, an assessment of the tumor may include the following:         -   Benign tumor : A noncancerous tumor that usually grows slowly and does not spread. Most pituitary tumors are benign.    -  Invasive tumor: A tumor that spreads into other tissues.     -  Malignant tumor: A cancerous tumor made of cells that grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors of the pituitary gland are very rare.    -  Metastatic tumor: A tumor that has spread from the pituitary gland to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Pituitary tumors are usually grouped by the following:\\n                    Whether the tumor makes too many hormones   A tumor that makes extra hormones can cause unusual changes in the body. There are different types of hormone-making tumors based on the kind of hormone the tumor makes.      Nonfunctioning tumors do not make extra hormones and there are no unusual changes in the body. Nonfunctioning tumors are made up of cells that usually make hormones in the body under normal conditions. These cells may make too many hormones as they become tumor cells. Other cells in the body receive the signals from the hormones and respond by making certain changes. Overproduction of different hormones can cause the following:              -  Growth Hormone : In adults, growth hormone may increase blood sugar, interfere with the hormone insulin, and cause acromegaly. Too much growth hormone in children may cause gigantism.    -  Adrenocorticotropic hormone: Causes the adrenal glands (a pair of glands that sit on top of each kidney) to make certain steroid hormones including cortisol. Cortisol is the \\\"stress hormone\\\" that helps your body respond to stress and has many other vital functions. Too much adrenocorticotropic hormone can cause Cushing syndrome.    -  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Causes the kidneys to hold water. In rare cases, tumor cells may cause too much ADH. This usually results in a tumor in another part of the body that spreads to the pituitary gland. The changes caused by too much ADH include water overloading, hyponatremia (low blood sodium) and high blood pressure.    -  Thyroid-stimulating hormone: Stimulates the thyroid gland, which is in the neck, to make the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones control the speed of your metabolism. Too much thyroid-stimulating hormone can cause hyperthyroidism.    -  Prolactin: Prolactin stimulates breast milk production in women who have recently given birth. Women who are not pregnant or have not recently given birth may start to produce breast milk and have changes in their menstrual cycle. In men, too much prolactin can cause erectile dysfunction. Prolactin also controls the cells in the pituitary gland. Normal prolactin levels cause normal changes during puberty, during pregnancy, when breast-feeding, and during changes after menopause.          Size of the tumor   The size of the tumor after it is removed is based on how big the tumor is. A microadenoma is less than 10 mm and a macroadenoma is 10 mm or greater.

This may involve radiation therapy, surgery, or hormonal therapy. (Hormone therapy is the use of hormones to fight cancer or lessen cancer symptoms. See the Hormone Replacement Treatment section below for more information.) Other specialists may include the following:         -  Endocrinologist.     -  Neurosurgeon.     -  Neuroradiation oncologist.     -  Neuro-oncologist.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Pituitary tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years.\\n                    Some signs or symptoms caused by pituitary tumors continue after treatment.

Palliative treatments vary widely and include the following:         -  Hormone replacement therapy to replace hormones that are no longer made by the body or to lessen the effect of hormones made by the tumor.     -  Steroid therapy to replace cortisol, which is important in the body's response to stress and its regulation of blood pressure and the immune system.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery      Surgery is a common treatment of pituitary tumors, especially tumors larger than 10 millimeters (macroadenomas). The surgical removal of the tumor causes damage to the pituitary gland in almost all patients. Surgery may also cause damage to the hypothalamus, optic nerve, or carotid artery, or to nearby structures of the brain.    There are several types of surgery. The type of surgery used depends on the size and location of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread to other areas of the pituitary gland.           -  Transsphenoidal approach: Surgery to remove the tumor is done through the nose and the sphenoid bone (a butterfly-shaped bone that forms part of the base of the skull). Transsphenoidal surgery may also be done at the same time as stereotactic radiation therapy. A combination of these two treatments may lessen the chance that the tumor will come back. Most pituitary tumors are removed using this type of surgery. Transsphenoidal surgery is not done to remove pituitary carcinomas (cancer that has spread from the pituitary gland).     -  Transcranial approach: Surgery to remove the tumor is done through an opening in the skull. This type of surgery may be used to remove very large or fast-growing tumor.    After surgery to remove the tumor, the patient continues to be endocrinologically evaluated on a regular basis to check for the need for lifelong hormone or corticosteroid therapy.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds,\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with pituitary tumors.    - Four standard types of treatment are used:         - Surgery     - Radiation therapy     - Radiosurgery     - Hormone therapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with pituitary tumors.\\n                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with pituitary tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.

The types of surgery used to treat pituitary tumors include the following:               -  Transsphenoidal surgery: A surgical procedure to remove tumors of the pituitary gland. The tumor is reached through the nose and nasopharynx (the area at the back of the nose that connects with the throat). This type of surgery is done using instruments inserted through the nostrils and, if needed, a microscope to see the tumor. It is called transsphenoidal because the instruments go through the sphenoid bone.                -  Craniotomy : A surgical operation in which a bone flap is temporarily removed from the skull to access the brain. The bone flap is put back after the brain surgery is done.         Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging the healthy tissue around the tumor. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a special machine to place a radioactive implant directly into or near the tumor.       -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a machine to deliver radiation to the tumor. Sometimes, a frame is attached to the skull to keep the head from moving during treatment. If the tumor is in the pituitary gland, a special headpiece is used to keep the head from moving during treatment. Certain also ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging the healthy tissue around the tumor. This type of external radiation therapy may also be called stereotaxic radiation therapy, stereotaxic radiation therapy, or stereotaxic external radiation therapy.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat pituitary tumors.     Pituitary tumors are very close to the brain and very sensitive parts of the nervous system. Radiation therapy to treat pituitary tumors may damage these parts of the brain. A radiation oncologist should be part of the treatment team. This doctor specializes in giving radiation treatment.       Radiosurgery     Radiosurgery is radiation treatment that uses special equipment to place a small, radioactive implant directly into or near a tumor or to aim a beam of high-energy radiation at a tumor. Radioactive implants give off radiation over a period of time. The implant does not stay in the body. Radiosurgery to the brain may be done in a single treatment using a machine that moves around the outside of the head and sends radiation to the exact spot, such as a pituitary tumor. If the tumor is in the pituitary gland, a special headpiece is used to keep the head from moving during treatment. Gamma-knife radiosurgery and linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery are two types of radiosurgery.     Radiosurgery to treat pituitary tumors may damage sensitive parts of the nervous system, such as nerves in the eye. A radiation oncologist should be part of the treatment team to give this treatment.       Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is treatment that removes, blocks, or adds hormones. For pituitary tumors that make extra hormones, drugs are given that change the way extra hormones work or help to lower the amount of extra hormones in the body.

Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Six types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the tumor through an operation) may be used to diagnose and treat pituitary tumors. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment to kill tumor cells that remain after surgery, or to keep them from growing, is called adjuvant therapy.       -  Transsphenoidal surgery: Surgery to remove a pituitary tumor through the nose and sphenoid sinus, which is the nasal cavity just behind the nose. This type of surgery is called transsphenoidal surgery.     -  Transfrontal surgery: Surgery to remove a pituitary tumor through an opening made in the frontal bone near the eyebrows. This type of surgery may be done when the tumor is large or has spread to the area around the pituitary gland. Treatment is usually followed by radiation therapy to kill remaining tumor cells.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat pituitary tumors. It is usually given after surgery. Shaping a radiation beam to match the tumor is called conformal radiotherapy. When radiation treatment is given that uses conformal radiotherapy, the radiation beams are shaped to match the tumor.     The treatment plan may include a clinical trial of a new drug or technique to make the radiotherapy more effective and reduce side effects.     Sixnitrosoureas     - Carmustine (BiCNU)     - Lomustine (Gleostine)     - Streptozocin       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect the cancer in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.     For pituitary tumors, chemotherapy is used if surgery and radiation therapy are not able to cure the tumor.    See Drugs Approved for Brain, Head and Neck Cancers for more information.       Radiosurgery     Radiosurgery is radiation therapy that uses special x-ray equipment to place a radiation source close to or inside the tumor.       Hormone therapy     In hormone therapy, drugs stop the glands or organs in the body from producing hormones, or interfere with the effects of the hormones. If the pituitary tumor produces hormones, hormone therapy is used to help relieve symptoms.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Treatment Options for Pituitary Tumors\\n                    Treatment options depend on:         - The size of the tumor.    - Whether the tumor is making hormones.     - Whether the tumor is causing symptoms.    - Whether the tumor is a macroadenoma or a microadenoma.    - Whether the tumor is cancerous.    - Whether the tumor has spread to the brain and other parts of the body.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with pituitary tumors.    - The treatment of pituitary tumors may include the following:         -  Surgery     -  Robotic surgery - a type of microsurgery that may include da Vinci robotic system     - Radiation therapy     -  Radiosurgery     - Drug therapy        -  Watchful waiting may be used before beginning treatment for small pituitary tumors that do not cause signs or symptoms.    - Patients should be supported in their treatment choices.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - For some patients palliative or supportive care may be given.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with pituitary tumors.\\n                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with pituitary tumors.

The most common type of surgery for benign pituitary tumors is transsphenoidal surgery. High doses of corticosteroids can help with controlling and preparing for side effects that may occur before, during, and after surgery.     Surgery to remove pituitary tumors that spread into the brain is rarely successful.    Microscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a type of microsurgery to remove the pituitary tumor using special surgical instruments and a small magnifying glass. Most patients are awake during the procedure.       Robotic surgery - a type of microsurgery that may include da Vinci robotic system     The da Vinci robotic system is a robotic surgical system that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat some tumors. The da Vinci system is used to perform robot-assisted, minimally invasive surgery. The system is made up of three components: a surgical console, a patient-side cart with robotic arms, and a vision system. The surgeon operates seated at the console viewing the surgical site in a high-definition 3-dimensional (3-D) view. The robotic arms hold surgical instruments and a camera that are inserted into the body. The surgeon's hand movements are translated into smaller, more precise movements of the instruments. The da Vinci system has been used to treat some patients with pituitary tumors. However, this use is not approved by the FDA.    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of radiation therapy and whether it is part of the treatment of the tumor or is being used to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat pituitary tumors.    Even when the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery will kill any remaining tumor cells and decrease the chance that the tumor will come back. Radiation therapy to the pituitary gland will stop all hormone production other than melatonin. The patient will be given drugs to replace the hormones that are no longer made by the pituitary gland.     See the General Information section of this summary for more information about pituitary tumors.       Radiosurgery     Radiosurgery is a type of radiation therapy that uses special equipment to place a few very small beams of radiation directly on the tumor. Because the radiation is very carefully focused, there is less damage to healthy tissue. It is also called stereotactic radiosurgery and gamma-knife therapy.     The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether it is part of the treatment of the tumor or is being used to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat pituitary tumors.       Drug therapy    Check the list of  NCI's Cancer Drugs Approved for Pituitary Tumors for drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pituitary tumors.

Six types of surgery are used to treat pituitary tumors:             -  Transsphenoidal microsurgery. A small incision (cut) is made right behind the upper lip. The tumor is then taken out through the opening of the nose, or through the small incision and the area of the sphenoid bone. A small telescope (endoscope) or microscope and surgical tools are inserted through the opening in the nose or the incision. The doctor uses the tools to remove the tumor from the pituitary gland. Because there is little or no damage to brain tissue, this surgery is associated with fewer side effects and a quick recovery. A side effect may include trouble with feeling or movement. Other side effects depend on the hormone secreted by the tumor or the hormone missing because of tumor growth or removal of the tumor.     -  Sublabial transsphenoidal surgery. A small incision (cut) is made under the upper lip, and surgical tools are inserted through the opening to remove the tumor from the pituitary gland. A microscope is used during the surgery.     -  Endonasal transsphenoidal microsurgery. A long tube with lenses (endoscope) is inserted into the nostril and moved through the back of the nasal cavity into the sphenoid sinus (air spaces that lead into the back of the nose) to the pituitary gland. Surgery is then done through the endoscope.     -  Transcranial surgery. A surgical opening (craniotomy) is made from the inside of the skull. Before surgery, an area of the outer bone of the skull is cut. During surgery, a special saw is used to remove an opening in the bone of the skull. The dura (the tissue that covers the brain) is opened, and the tumor is removed. After surgery, the piece of skull is put back, and the tissue that covers the brain is closed with stitches or small metal clips. Sometimes the skin on the scalp grows over the bone and stitches do not need to be removed.     -  Open surgery. An incisiion is made in the skin of the face or inside the skull. This is used when tumors are spread over an area and it is not safe to remove with transsphenoidal microsurgery or transcranial surgery.     -  Stereotactic surgery. A head frame or a stereotactic mask is placed to keep the head still during surgery. The head frame or mask has pointers that are used as a guide to locate areas in and around the pituitary gland where the surgery will be done.             Side effects of surgery may include trouble with feeling or movement. Other side effects depend on the hormone secreted by the tumor or the hormone missing because of tumor growth or removal of the tumor.    Even if the doctor removes all the pituitary tumor that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy to kill any tumor cells that are left. Treatment with radiation therapy may lower the chance of the tumor coming back.

It lies just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The size of the prostate changes as a man gets older. In men under 40 years old, the prostate is about the size of a walnut. By the time a man reaches 60, the prostate is normally about the size of a lemon. The urethra goes through the center of the prostate from the bladder. The prostate has two main functions:         -   It helps make semen, the fluid that contains sperm.      -   It helps control urine flow.          A healthy adult prostate has three layers of different types of cells. The central zone is in the center of the prostate, around the urethra. The transition zone surrounds the central zone, and the peripheral zone surrounds the transition zone. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not cancer, occurs in the transition zone. Cancer mostly occurs in the peripheral zone.   Prostate cancer is common in men over 50. Prostate cancer may cause pain, problems urinating, problems with sexual function, or loss of bladder or bowel control. Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. Check with a doctor if you have any of these problems.    Transrectal ultrasound is used to diagnose prostate cancer and to find out how far the cancer has spread. Prostate cancer may be diagnosed by taking blood samples for the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and examining the cells of the prostate under a microscope. A procedure in which the doctor inserts a needle into the prostate to remove samples of tissue is called a prostate biopsy. It is done to diagnose prostate cancer. A newly approved imaging study called a multiparametric MRI may be done before a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer. The results of these tests are used to help plan treatment.   Prostate cancers appear to vary widely in their tendency to grow and spread, depending on where they are found and how they look under a microscope. Most newly diagnosed prostate cancers are found to be localized or regional (confined to the prostate or close to it), and many newly diagnosed prostate cancers are thought to grow slowly. These cancers may cause few or no symptoms. They may later stop growing or stop spreading. Other prostate cancers are more likely to spread quickly.   Cancer that is in the prostate only or has spread only to nearby areas, tissues, or lymph nodes is called \u201clocalized\u201d or \u201cregional\u201d cancer. Cancer in other parts of the body, such as the bones or distant lymph nodes, is called \u201cdistant\u201d cancer. See the Prostate Cancer Survival Rates section of this summary for more information.

The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. For the physical exam of the prostate, the doctor or nurse feels the size, shape, and hardness of the prostate. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   PSA blood test : A test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate. In general, a small amount of PSA circulates in the blood, but a higher than normal amount can be a sign of infection or inflammation of the prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or prostate cancer. Sometimes the PSA level goes down if there is inflammation in the prostate. For this reason, doctors sometimes treat infections or inflammation of the prostate and then repeat the PSA test. There are many other non-cancerous (\\\"benign\\\") conditions that can raise the PSA level. Other tests may be needed to see if cancer is present.    -   Free PSA test : A test to measure the amount of PSA that is not attached (free) to proteins in the blood. A certain amount of PSA in the blood is not attached, such as PSA from cancer cells. A higher percentage of free PSA may mean the patient does not have cancer and this is especially true if this percent is higher than 25%. A lower percentage may mean that a biopsy is needed.       If tests show that there may be cancer, a biopsy is done to be sure. A biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer. Tissue samples are removed from the prostate and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a prostate biopsy, the doctor uses a needle attached to an ultrasound probe to remove tissue samples. Sometimes, patients and doctors may consider active surveillance for prostate cancer before a treatment plan is made. Active surveillance is closely watching a patients condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. This includes having CT scans and other tests done to watch for signs of cancer.

If you have any of these signs or symptoms, talk to your doctor.    Tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose (confirm) cancer. If cancer is found, more tests will be done to find out if it has spread to other parts of the body. The process used to find out whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging.

Screening blood tests and exams are used to help detect cancer early, before there are signs or symptoms. Two tests are currently used:         -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.    -  Digital rectal exam (DRE). If the doctor feels an abnormal lump during the DRE, is able to feel the entire prostate gland and the PSA blood test is normal, or there are other risk factors for prostate cancer except for an abnormal PSA level, an MRI may be done before the patient is referred to a urologist.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood and digital rectal exam (DRE) tests are used for screening.\\n                    Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein made by cells in the prostate gland. Both cancerous and noncancerous conditions, such as enlargement of the prostate or infection of the prostate, can increase the PSA level. The results of the PSA test are given as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. A lower PSA level is better. For example, a PSA level under 4.0 ng/mL is usually considered normal; however, men over 50 years old may have levels up to 6.5 that are considered normal. PSA levels may also be considered normal for men of different ages. Levels above the normal range may be a sign of prostate cancer or of other conditions.     The PSA test is often combined with a digital rectal exam (DRE) to check the health of the prostate.    Recommend a conversation about prostate cancer screening     The American Cancer Society recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. This means that men should understand what they are being screened for, the risks of screening and treatment, and the benefits of screening and treatment.    Men who make a decision to be screened for prostate cancer should have a PSA test with or without a DRE.   Before having the test, men should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening. Some factors, such as a family history of prostate cancer or being African-American, may affect a man's risk of prostate cancer and should be discussed with the health care provider.

The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum and feels for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Because the prostate gland is next to the rectum, it is sometimes possible to feel the size, shape, and hardness of the prostate. An abnormal-feeling prostate may be a sign of cancer or other conditions that block the flow of urine.     -   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate. PSA is usually higher in men who have prostate cancer. However, a high PSA level may also be due to infection or inflammation of the prostate or to an enlargement of the prostate.    -   Transrectal ultrasound : A procedure used to examine the prostate and nearby tissues for abnormal areas. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs in order to make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can see the sonogram on a video screen to look for abnormal areas.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The following procedure may be used to collect the sample of tissue:               -    Transrectal biopsy : A transrectal biopsy is an exam to check the prostate gland for cancer cells. A hollow needle is inserted through the wall of the rectum and into the prostate gland to remove tissue samples. A pathologist views the tissue samples under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This is usually done with transrectal ultrasound to guide the needle.             Sometimes the cancer may not be found even though it is in the prostate. Lab tests are done on the tissue to learn more about the cancer and how fast it may grow. This helps the doctor plan treatment. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may order additional tests such as MRI and a bone scan to find out if the cancer has spread.     -   Pathology review : A review of cells and tissues by a pathologist with special training in the area of cancer diagnosis. The pathologist gives each cancer a grade based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with an endorectal coil: A procedure used to detect abnormal areas in the prostate. The patient lies inside a machine that uses radio waves and a strong magnet to make images of the prostate and rectum. An endorectal coil is taped to an endoscope (thin, flexible tube with a light and a lens for viewing) which is placed in the rectum. This creates a clearer image of the prostate and nearby structures.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lymph nodes and bones, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. If a CT scan is used to check the abdomen, the procedure is called abdominopelvic CT scan.     -   Bone scan : A procedure used to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

Twenty years ago, the concern of cancer specialists was limited to diagnosis, treatment options, clinical trials, and treatment side effects. Today, experts recognize the importance of the entire cancer survivorship experience, from diagnosis until the end of life, and beyond. Multiple national groups, including the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Survivorship and LiveStrong, address issues associated with the aftermath of a diagnosis of cancer. The goal of the cancer survivorship movement is to provide better coordination of cancer care, help survivors with problems that are usually seen late in cancer, support research, and provide education. \\\"Cancer survivorship\\\" is defined within this framework as the period from diagnosis until the end of life, no matter how long a person survives.    A prostate cancer prognosis is the likely outcome or course of the disease; it is the chance of recovery or recurrence. Prostate cancer prognosis depends on the following:         - How fast the cancer is growing.    - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.    - How the cancer responds to treatment.    - Whether the cancer recurs (comes back) after treatment.        Most men who do develop prostate cancer do not die from it. Treatment of prostate cancer may be delayed in some men, especially if the cancer caused no symptoms at the time of diagnosis and was found by chance during a biopsy. Treatment can begin if there are signs the cancer is getting worse. Another reason treatment of slow-growing prostate cancer can be delayed for some men is a concern about the possible side effects of the treatment. Doctors also consider the men's preferences for their care.

African-American men and men who have a father or brother with prostate cancer have a greater risk of developing the disease.  Prostate cancer may cause no symptoms at first. When untreated, symptoms can include pain in the back, hips or pelvis, or problems urinating. These symptoms may be caused by other conditions. See a health care provider if you have them.  The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and digital rectal exam (DRE) are often used to screen for prostate cancer. However, there is disagreement about whether healthy men should be screened for prostate cancer. If tests show you might have cancer, you'll get a biopsy. If cancer is found, you will discuss treatment options with your doctor. You may also want to see a prostate cancer specialist. Treatment options are affected by the cancer's risk category or stage.

The results of some of the tests used to diagnose prostate cancer may also be used in the staging process. (See the General Information section.)   The following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly growing bone cells in a specific area. This procedure is also called a technetium bone scan or a radionuclide bone scan. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. As the radioactive material travels through the bone, a scanner detects the radioactivity and any areas of bone growth or break down. Bone tissue around cancer cells grows faster than normal bone tissue and shows up as \\\"hot spots\\\" on the scan.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Lymphadenectomy : The removal of lymph nodes to see if there are cancer cells in them.

A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes the PET scan is done at the same time as a CT scan. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.

See the Stages section of this summary for more information.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph vessels are similar to blood vessels, but they carry a clear fluid called lymph rather than blood. Cancer cells may get stuck in the lymph vessels and grow into tumors in the lymph nodes. Or they may continue to travel through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.    Blood vessels carry blood to and from all areas of the body. Cancer cells may get stuck in the blood vessels and grow into tumors in organs or tissues. Or they may continue to travel through the blood vessels to other areas of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Prostate cancer may spread from where it began in the prostate gland to other parts of the body.\\n                    Prostate cancer can spread to nearby organs, the bones, or lymph nodes under the pelvis. It can also spread to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following stages are used for prostate cancer:\\n                    Stage I     In stage I, cancer is found in the prostate only. The cancer may be in a small area of the prostate, or the cancer may be found throughout half or less than half of the prostate. Cancer cells look almost like normal cells and are grouped as Gleason score 6. The tumor may also be found by accident during surgery for another prostate problem.          Stage II    In stage II, cancer is found in the prostate only. Cancer may be found in half or more of the prostate. Cancer cells are grouped as Gleason score 7 or tumor cells are grouped as undifferentiated (Gleason score 8 - 10).         Stage III     In stage III, cancer:            - has spread outside the prostate to nearby tissues;      - has spread to the seminal vesicles; or     -  cannot be completely removed by surgery.        The cancer may be found in other parts of the body. The cancer is grouped as any Gleason score.          Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB.            -  In stage IVA, cancer:                  - has spread outside the prostate to nearby organs; or       - has spread to a lymph node near the pelvis.            - In stage IVB, cancer:                  - has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body farther from the prostate; or       - has spread to the muscle at the base of the penis or to the lining of the rectum.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Four types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common way of treating prostate cancer. The following surgical methods may be used:             -  Radical prostatectomy: Surgery in which the entire prostate gland, part of the urethra, and, depending on the extent of the cancer, nearby tissue and lymph nodes are removed. There are different types of radical prostatectomy:                   -  Perineal prostatectomy is removal of the prostate through an incision (cut) in the perineum, the area between the scrotum and anus.      -  Retropubic prostatectomy is removal of the prostate through an incision in the lower abdomen. This type of surgery may be done as a nerve-sparing operation, and may allow patients to regain continence and potency.       -  Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: Surgery to remove the prostate using a laparoscope (a thin video camera) inserted through small incisions in the abdomen. Instruments are used to perform the surgery. The patient's position at a slight tilt allows the intestines to move to one side while the instrument arm of the robot moves around the patient on an arc. The tilt also improves the view for the surgeon.     -  Transurethral resection of the prostate: A surgical procedure used to relieve symptoms caused by prostate cancer, such as difficulty urinating. It is most often used when the patient is not able to have surgery to remove the entire tumor. A resectoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a wire loop on the end) is inserted through the tip of the penis into the urethra. The wire loop is used to remove prostate tissue, including any parts that are blocking urine flow through the urethra. This procedure is also used when a patient is having hormone or radiation therapy. It may help reduce side effects of these therapies or complications from the prostate continuing to grow during therapy. Therapy to the prostate thereafter may be cited as transurethral resection of the prostate, biopsy only.               Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                   -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of external radiation therapy. SBRT is a method of giving radiation treatment using special tools and imaging to very precisely aim radiation beams at a tumor from multiple angles. The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses that are given over several days, called fractions. With SBRT, the radiation is usually given in fewer fractions than standard radiation therapy.       -  Three-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiation therapy: A type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional picture of the inside of the body and is used to deliver a radiation dose that is shaped to fit the tumor.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): A type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses a computer to adjust the radiation dose received by healthy tissue and the tumor.       -  Proton beam radiation therapy:  A type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small positively charged particles of matter) to make radiation. The radiation peaks as it enters the tumor, causing little damage to tissue outside the tumor. This removes the need to change the treatment plan for tumors that move as the patient breathes. The risk of subfertility in male patients who receive proton beam radiation therapy is lower than the risk in those who receive high-energy x-ray\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.    - Prostate cancer may cause symptoms and signs.    - Patients who have surgery or who receive radiation therapy are watched closely for several years to see if the cancer has recurred.    - Three types of standard treatment are used:         -   Active Surveillance     -   Surgery     -   Radiation Therapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.\\n                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with prostate cancer.

When signs or symptoms occur, they may be caused by prostate cancer or by other conditions. Signs and symptoms include the following:         -  Problems urinating, including a slow or weak urinary stream or the need to urinate more often, especially at night.    -  Blood in the urine.    -  Trouble having an erection.    - Pain in the pelvis, hips, or back.    -  Pain or burning during urination.    -  Frequent pain and stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients who have surgery or who receive radiation therapy are watched closely for several years to see if the cancer has recurred.\\n                    Recurrence can be local, regional, or distant. When cancer is found after treatment for cancer, it may be called recurrent cancer. It may come back in the same place as the original (primary) tumor or in other parts of the body. Prostate cancer can recur; if it does, it may spread to other parts of the body, such as bone. For tumors of the prostate, x-rays may be taken at the first sign of bone pain. Additional tests may be taken after treatment for the initial tumor to catch late recurrences. The following tests may be used:         -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A test to measure the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate. For men who have had surgery or radiation therapy for prostate cancer, this test is used to find out whether very low levels of PSA are in the blood. PSA levels after surgery may not be zero because normal prostate cells may remain after surgery. A small increase in PSA levels after radiation therapy can be normal. Slight increases over this level may be taken as a sign that the cancer has recurred or is growing free of the prostate.    -  Imaging tests: Tests that make images of the inside of the body. Common imaging tests used to find and see whether prostate cancer has recurred include the following:               -  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lungs, liver, bone, and other organs, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.      -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).      -  Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Active Surveillance     Active surveillance is closely watching a patients condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is also called watchful waiting, especially if used for an older patient or a patient with other medical problems. Patients on active surveillance have fewer urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormone-related side effects than patients who have surgery or radiation therapy to treat their prostate cancer.

Instead of receiving treatment, patients are treated only if symptoms occur that need treatment. Tests and exams are done often to check if the condition has changed.   Watchful waiting may be used to treat early-stage prostate cancer, particularly in older patients and those who have other medical conditions. These patients may not need immediate treatment, and treatment may be missed without harm.       Surgery    Radical prostatectomy is surgery to remove the entire prostate gland and some of the tissue around it, including the seminal vesicles. There are different ways to do a radical prostatectomy:             -  Retropubic prostatectomy: A surgical incision (cut) is made under the bellybutton or between the scrotum and rectum. A carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the space inside the abdomen. This causes the abdomen to expand so that the surgeon can see the organs and tissues. Special surgical instruments attached to robotic arms are inserted through small incisions (cuts) in the abdomen, and the surgeon controls the arms to remove the prostate gland. The incisions are then covered with a small bandage. A surgeon may also remove lymph nodes from the groin and examine them to see if they contain cancer cells.     -  Laparoscopic prostatectomy: Surgery as described above.    -  Perineal prostatectomy: A surgical incision (cut) is made in the skin between the scrotum and rectum to remove the prostate gland. A surgeon may also remove lymph nodes from the groin and examine them to see if they contain cancer cells.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.        The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat prostate cancer.       Hormone therapy is a treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops hormone production. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If cancer cells have hormone receptors, drugs, surgery, or other treatments to remove or block the hormones may be used to try to slow, stop, or prevent cancer growth.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.     Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).

These approaches may be used for some elderly patients and those with other serious illnesses. Patients are monitored with PSA blood tests. If there are signs the cancer is growing, treatment is given. Differences between watchful waiting and active surveillance include:            -  During active surveillance, a curative treatment such as surgery or radiation will be done if the tests show the cancer is growing. During watchful waiting, symptoms are treated if they occur or if the cancer is likely to cause symptoms.    - During active surveillance, patients are monitored more closely.              Surgery     Surgery (removal of the prostate) is an option for patients who have localized prostate cancer. Treatment to remove the prostate may include the following:             -  Radical prostatectomy: Removal of the entire prostate gland and some of the tissue around it, including the seminal vesicles (the tubes that carry semen). A pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes in the pelvic area) may also be done. If cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes, treatment is stopped and additional treatment is started. The doctor may also remove the lymph nodes if the cancer is likely to grow and spread. A different operation, called a radical retropubic prostatectomy, may be used for some patients. During recovery from either procedure, the patient may need to use a urinary bag (a catheter).     -  Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): A surgical procedure to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor that is blocking the flow of urine through the urethra. In some patients, this is also used to cure the cancer. The doctor inserts a resectoscope into the urethra and removes part of the prostate gland using a wire loop that cuts tissue and seals it off with an electrical current. This procedure is also called transurethral prostatectomy, transurethral prostatic resection, and transurethral resection of bladder outlet obstruction.              See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy, such as three-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), allow the radiation to be aimed more directly at the tumor in order to lessen the damage to healthy tissue.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat prostate cancer.      In addition, radioactive seeds may be implanted into the prostate. Treatment with implanted radioactive seeds is called brachytherapy. See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information. Treatments to relieve symptoms from prostate cancer:            -  TURP, to relieve urinary obstruction or the inability to urinate.     -  Cryosurgery to kill cancer cells.        Hormone therapy     Prostate cancer cells usually need the male hormone testosterone to help them grow. Hormone therapy is used to stop the cancer cells from getting testosterone. This may make the cancer shrink or grow more slowly.    Hormone therapy used in the treatment of prostate cancer may include:            -  Orchiectomy: Surgery to remove the testes (balls). This keeps the testes from making testosterone.    \",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.     - Three types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery      - Radiation therapy      - Hormone therapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.     - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with prostate cancer.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are already open to patients and others are underway.   For prostate cancer patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Because bone metastases are common in patients with prostate cancer, clinical trials for this type of cancer may be studying new ways of treating the cancer and lessening bone problems.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                     Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of prostate cancer.       Surgery to remove the prostate (radical prostatectomy) can be used to treat prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body. When prostate cancer spreads, eliminating the cancer may not be possible and treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing further spread.       Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       See Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer for more information.

Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulate in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that your cancer may be helped by hormone therapy, discussions with both your urologist and your medical oncologist are important.

High-intensity focused ultrasound     High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a local treatment that uses ultrasound waves to raise the temperature of tumor tissue and destroy cancer cells.    Androgen/androgen receptor-targeted therapy    Androgen/androgen receptor-targeted therapy blocks the effects of androgen hormones and can include surgical orchiectomy and the use of anti-androgens or androgen/androgen receptor-targeted (ARAT) drugs. Orchiectomy is the surgical removal of one or both testicles without ionizing radiation (see Surgery). When only part of a testicle is removed, it is called partial orchiectomy. Orchiectomy is a type of hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Anti-androgens prevent androgen from attaching to the androgen receptor on cells.

Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Combination chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses more than one anticancer drug.

It lies just under the bladder and in front of the rectum. The urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder and out through the penis, runs through the center of the prostate. The size of the prostate changes as men get older. The prostate of a young man is about the size of a walnut. As a man ages, the prostate may get larger.    The prostate has these main parts:         -   Stroma: The innermost part of the prostate.    -   Glands: Tube-like structures that make fluids that are part of semen. These fluids nourish and help sperm move.    -  Capsule: A thin \\\"skin\\\" on the outside of the prostate that separates it from other tissues.        Cancer is found more often in the glands than in the stroma. Cancer is less likely to be found in the capsule because the capsule is not a part of the prostate. The prostate may also enlarge as a man ages, but it does not usually get larger because of cancer.       See the following PDQ summaries for more information about prostate problems:         -  Prostate Enlargement (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia): Screening and Treatment     -  Prostatitis Treatment\\n                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t        \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t        \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    Prostate cancer usually grows slowly and initially remains confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    Untreated prostate cancer can spread beyond the prostate and to other parts of the body.    Prostate cancer may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the bones and lymph nodes. When cancer cells break away from the primary (original) tumor and travel through the lymph or blood to other places in the body, another (secondary) tumor may form. This process is called metastasis. Metastatic tumor cells are the same type of cells as the primary tumor cells. For example, if prostate cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells. The disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer.     There are different kinds of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

These and other side effects may happen soon after treatment or months or years after treatment.

A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. A digital rectal exam (DRE) is done to check the size of the prostate and feel for lumps on the surface of the gland. A history of the patient's symptoms, including trouble urinating, pain in the urinary tract or in the bones, and a family history of prostate cancer, will be taken.     -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test : A procedure in which blood is taken from a vein and checked for PSA, a substance made by the prostate that is often found in greater than normal amounts in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.    -  Transrectal ultrasound : A procedure used to examine the prostate and nearby tissues for abnormal areas. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of the inside of the prostate on a computer screen, and a small amount of tissue is removed (biopsied).

Other results from this study are being reviewed by an outside panel of expert physicians, researchers, and biostatisticians. This panel will advise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on these results. Based on their review of the other results, the panel will recommend FDA approval or non-approval of finasteride to reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men.     A study to find out if dutasteride (brand name Avodart) can prevent prostate cancer in men who do not have symptoms of prostate cancer but have an increased risk of the disease is now open and is accepting patients.

Farmers and men who work on farms may have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer.

The prostate gland controls urine flow by closing urethra during ejaculation.     The prostate gland helps make semen, the thick white fluid that carries sperm.    Cancer that forms in tissues of the prostate usually grows slowly and initially remains within the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm.

The back of the gland contains ducts that carry prostate fluid into the urethra. These ducts and a few glands form a central area around the urethra. Most of the rest of the prostate is made up of muscle and glands that make prostate fluid.    A healthy prostate helps make semen, which is the fluid that contains sperm.

As cancer grows, it may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the bones and lymph nodes.     This summary describes the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent prostate cancer. When treatment of prostate cancer is discussed, the type of prostate cancer should be taken into consideration. Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas.

Whether tests for prostate cancer are used depends on a man's individual risk factors, such as age and personal history. In addition, guidelines created by different groups may disagree about who should be tested and how often a man should be tested. (See the \\\"Screening\\\" section of this summary.) Learn more about prostate cancer prevention and early detection in the PDQ summary on Prostate Cancer Prevention.   If the cancer has spread throughout the prostate gland and to areas beyond the prostate gland, it may be hard to remove all of the cancer. It may also be difficult to treat and cure cancer that has spread outside the prostate, because the cancer has to be completely removed or destroyed to cure the patient. Therefore, there is a higher chance that prostate cancer that is found early, while it is still small and confined to the prostate, can be cured.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Sometimes, prostate cancer may not need treatment right away.\\n                    Prostate cancer can be slow-growing, and may not spread quickly. When small amounts of prostate cancer spread to the lymph nodes or bones, patients may be treated with hormone therapy or referred to a clinical trial.

Age, race, and family history are the most important risk factors for prostate cancer.    - Age: The risk of prostate cancer increases with age.    - Race: African-American men have a greater risk of prostate cancer than men of other races; they are also more likely to have advanced cancer when it is diagnosed and more likely to die of prostate cancer.    - Family history: Having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man's risk of developing this disease. The risk increases further according to  how many  relatives have prostate cancer, their age at diagnosis, and whether they are from the father's or the mother's side of the family. Having a family history of other cancers, such as breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer, may also increase the risk of prostate cancer.   Other risk factors for prostate cancer include obesity and smoking. Obese men have an increased risk of getting and dying of aggressive prostate cancer. This risk is increased further in obese African-American men. Regular tobacco smoking may be linked to an increased risk of getting and dying of prostate cancer.    Studies show that eating certain foods might increase or lower the risk of having prostate cancer. Men who eat a lot of red meat or high-fat dairy products may have a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer. Men who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables may have a lower risk of prostate cancer. The risk of prostate cancer may be lower in men who eat foods high in lycopene (which is found in tomato products) or foods rich in selenium, but this has not been proven.   Medicines and supplements may change the risk of prostate cancer. Taking the drug finasteride (Proscar), which is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), lowers the risk of both low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer. Taking the drug dutasteride (Avodart) to treat BPH also lowers the risk of prostate cancer. However, taking these drugs increases the risk of being diagnosed with a high-grade tumor. It is not clear why this is so. Taking dietary supplements such as vitamin E and selenium was thought to lower the risk of prostate cancer, but the results of a large study showed that men who took vitamin E had an increased risk of prostate cancer.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.     If they travel through the lymph system, they enter the lymph vessels, which carry fluid and cells that help fight infection. The fluid in the vessels passes through the lymph nodes. Once cancer cells are in the lymph system, they can travel to any part of the body.     If they travel through the blood, they enter the blood vessels.

Each year, thousands of men and women are diagnosed with and die of colon and rectal cancer. Colon cancer and rectal cancer have many risk factors in common. It is important to note that, though risk factors influence the risk of getting a disease, most people do not know whether they will get cancer. Having a risk factor, such as a family history of colorectal cancer, does not mean that a person will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. It is important to talk with your doctor about your personal risk of cancer.    Having information about the risk of a disease can help you make decisions about your lifestyle and your health. There are some risk factors that you cannot change, such as increasing age or a family history of colorectal cancer. However, there are other risk factors over which you have some control, such as smoking and drinking alcohol.     Although colorectal cancer can occur in younger persons, the risk increases significantly after age 45. Because colorectal cancer often does not cause any symptoms in the early stages, persons over the age of 50 should talk with their doctor about screening. Early detection done through screening is very important because when colorectal cancer is found in the early stages and is completely removed by surgery, the chance for incresaed survival is very good. Colorectal cancer found in persons younger than 50 is often diagnosed at a later, more advanced stage, possibly because those persons are not routinely screened.     The following may increase the risk of colon and rectal cancer:            - Increasing age.    - Certain genetic syndromes caused by gene changes passed through generations of families, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).    - A personal history of:               - Colorectal cancer.      - Colorectal polyps.     - Long-standing (chronic) ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease.     - Ovarian, uterine, or breast cancer.            - A family history of:                - Colorectal cancer.      - Certain genetic syndromes.              -  A diet high in fat from animal sources.    -  Smoking cigarettes.    - Obesity.    -  Drinking alcohol.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Understanding Your Risk for Colon Cancer The American Cancer Society has an on-line tool that can help you estimate your risk of developing colon cancer. This tool will ask you to enter some information about you and your medical history. Based on the information you provide, the tool will tell you if your risk is the same, lower, or higher than average. It will also give you some general screening recommendations. Click here to access this tool.   Risk factors for colorectal cancer include age, sex, race/ethnicity, genetics and a history of certain diseases. If you are at increased risk for colorectal cancer, you may need to be screened at younger ages. Speak with your doctor about your risk.    Age Most patients with colorectal cancer are older than age 50. The one known exception is people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Certain studies have found that people with HIV get colorectal cancer at younger ages.    Gender Men have a higher risk of colorectal cancer than women.    Race and Ethnicity People in certain racial and ethnic groups have different risks of developing and dying from colorectal cancer.    African Americans have the highest rates of colorectal cancer in the United States. When comparing black and white patients, blacks tend to get colorectal cancer at a younger age, are diagnosed at a later stage, and have tumors with different molecular changes. It is important for black men and women to get tested for colorectal cancer: colorectal cancer screening can find polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Colorectal cancer screening can also find colorectal cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be cured.     Ashkenazi Jews have a higher risk of colon cancer than non-Jews.     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been found to have some of the lowest rates of colorectal cancer. However, studies show that rates of colorectal cancer as well as deaths from the disease have been increasing in this group.    About 50% of Native Alaskans will develop, or have already developed, colorectal cancer. This is either because of a very high-fat diet or a genetic predisposition.    The rates of colorectal cancer and deaths from colorectal cancer are rising in Hispanic/Latinos as well, although they remain lower than in non-Hispanic whites.         Previous Surgery or Medical Conditions    A personal history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps    If you have had colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps in the past, your doctors may recommend more intensive testing. Some patients may be advised to have genetic testing as well.    Having colorectal polyps (especially adenomatous or serrated polyps types) is very common and increases your risk for colorectal cancer. Adenomatous and serrated polyps are also called \\\"precancerous\\\" polyps, meaning they can turn into cancer. You may need to have a colonoscopy after some months or years to check if you need treatment for additional polyps. The American Cancer Society recommends that people found to have precancerous polyps should continue having periodic colorectal cancer screening, often including colonoscopy, for as long as they are healthy and have a life expectancy of at least 10 years. The timing of the next screening test should depend on the number, size, and type of polyps found.    Previous colorectal cancer: People who have had colorectal cancer may be at increased risk of another colorectal cancer in later years. That's why careful long-term follow-up is important. It may include regular colonoscopy checkups for many years.    Previous precancerous polyps: When one of these polyps is found, it is important to have follow-up examinations because there is a risk of new polyps forming in the colon. The risk depends on how many polyps were found, their size and type, and the presence of high-grade dysplasia. The amount of time between your follow-up examinations will be based on the results of your colonoscopy. However, some other diseases may require a different kind and/or schedule of follow-up.        A personal history of certain types of inflammatory bowel disease     Certain types of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can increase the risk for colorectal cancer. These include ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, especially if they are long-lasting. The risk increases the longer a person has this condition, particularly after 8 to 10 years. It also increases the more of the colon that is affected by the disease. Regular checkups, including colonoscopies, are important for people with these diseases.

Screening is looking for signs of cancer in healthy people who have no symptoms. Diagnostic tests are done to confirm the diagnosis when signs or symptoms are present.    Colon and rectal cancer may spread from the place where they first formed to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. They lodge in tissues and organs far from the primary tumor. The following tests and procedures may be used to detect colon cancer metastases:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This procedure is also called positron emission tomography.         For colon cancer screening, one of the following tests or procedures is used:         -   CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the colon and rectum, taken from different angles. The pictures are made into a 3-dimensional (3-D) model of the colon and rectum using a computer. This procedure is also called virtual colonoscopy, CT scanning, or computerized tomography.    -   Double-contrast barium enema : A series of x-rays of the colon and rectum. For the x-rays, air and barium (a silver-white metallic compound) are put into the colon and rectum by way of the anus. The barium coats the insides of the colon and rectum and the air that follows fills and expands the colon. The x-rays show the body from many different angles. Because barium makes the x-ray picture clearer, this procedure is called a \\\"double-contrast\\\" study.    -  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): A test to check stool (feces) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. Blood in the stool may be a sign of a growth or other disease in the colon or rectum. Samples of the stool are collected from several bowel movements and are checked in a lab.    -  Fecal immunochemical test (FIT): A test to check stool (feces) for blood that is hidden in the sample. Blood in the stool may be a sign of a growth or other disease in the colon or rectum.    -  Stool DNA test : A test to check for certain abnormal DNA markers that are sometimes seen in colon cancer and large polyps.

Screening tests may also find polyps or tumors when they are small, and these may be easier to treat. There are many different tests used to screen for bowel cancer. Different tests have different benefits and risks. Talk with your doctor about the best screening option for you. Screening begins at age 45 for people at average risk for developing colon cancer. If you are at increased or high risk of colorectal cancer, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent testing.    Screening tests for colon cancer include:       Double-contrast barium enema - x-ray examination of the colon and rectum. An enema is given that causes the colon and rectum to be coated with barium. Air is then pumped into the colon to expand it and provide a clear view of the inner surface of the colon and rectum on the x-ray pictures.    CT colonography - a series of detailed pictures of the colon and rectum are taken by a CT scanner. The pictures are made into a video screen picture to look for polyps and tumors. This procedure is also called virtual colonoscopy.      Flexible sigmoidoscopy - a procedure used to see inside the rectum and lower parts of the colon. A sigmoidoscope is inserted through the anus into the rectum and lower colon. A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. The scope may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.      Colonoscopy- a procedure used to see inside the rectum and the entire colon. A colonoscope is inserted through the anus into the rectum and colon. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. The doctor can also insert tools through the colonoscope to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.       Occult blood test - a test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that cannot be seen. Small samples of stool are placed on cards and returned to the health care provider or lab for testing. There are three types of occult blood tests:             -  Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT): This test checks for blood in the stool using a chemical reaction with a substance found on the test card.     -  Fecal immunochemical test (FIT): This test checks for blood in the stool using antibodies.     -  Fecal DNA (fDNA) test: This test checks for certain DNA markers in cells that are shed into the stool from cancer or polyp tissue.              Stool DNA tests may also include an immunochemical test to check for blood in the stool.   Laboratory personnel usually do not test the stool sample during your office visit. You will be given instructions on how to collect the stool sample and how to send the sample to the lab.    Some screening tests have a greater chance of finding polyps or colon cancer than others. Colonoscopy and CT colonography test the entire colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy only tests the lower third of the colon or rectum, and some doctors recommend colonoscopy at certain intervals following this test. Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy check for polyps in the same colon areas and polyps found by either test may be removed during the test. If polyps are not removed, a biopsy will be taken and checked for sign of cancer. Colonoscopy is the only test used to diagnose colon cancer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                 \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                    Diagnostic tests\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                    Diagnostic tests are done to confirm the diagnosis if signs or symptoms are present or if a screening test is abnormal. Diagnostic procedures used to diagnose colon cancer include the following:       -  Colonoscopy with biopsy: A colonoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine the inner lining of the large intestine (rectum and colon). A long, flexible tube (colonoscope) is inserted into the anus and advanced through the rectum and colon. A tiny video camera at the tip of the tube allows the doctor to view the inside of the entire colon. If there are any abnormal areas, the doctor can pass instruments through the colonoscope to take a tissue sample (biopsy) for examination under a microscope. A biopsy is the only sure way to know if an area of the body has cancer.     -  Double-contrast barium enema: An x-ray exam using an iodinated contrast material (a material that does not allow x-rays to pass through) to provide a clear view of the colon and rectum.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Fecal occult blood test : A test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that cannot be seen. Small samples of stool are placed on cards and tested in a lab. Blood in the stool may be a sign of a tumor or other condition.    -   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay : A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is a substance made by some cancer cells and may be found in the blood of someone who has colon cancer, some noncancerous conditions, and in smokers. It is not used to detect colon cancer, but if it is high, it may be a sign of colon cancer.     -   Double-contrast barium enema : A series of x-rays of the colon and rectum. For this test, air is pumped into the colon through the anus to expand the colon and make abnormalities more visible on the x-ray. Also, a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound) is inserted into the colon through the anus and coats the surface of the colon. This is called a barium enema. The barium makes the colon show up clearly on the x-ray. This procedure is sometimes used instead of a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Because taking a barium enema can be uncomfortable, patients may want to ask ahead of time how long it will take and whether they will need to take medicine to relieve discomfort.    -   Sigmoidoscopy : A procedure to look inside the rectum and sigmoid colon to check for polyps, abnormal growths, or cancer. The doctor or nurse inserts a hollow, rigid tube with a light into the rectum and slowly moves it into the colon. If polyps or other abnormal areas are found, the doctor or nurse may insert other instruments through the tube to remove polyps or take tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a proctosigmoidoscopy.    -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look at the inner lining of the large intestine (rectum and colon). A colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Sometimes colonoscopy is used instead of double-contrast barium enema to find polyps or areas of abnormal tissue.    -   Colon biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues from the colon.

After colon cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the colon or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the colon or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.

This procedure is also called endoscopy, colon endoscopy, and lower GI endoscopy.         - Colon biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues from the colon so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy is usually done during a colonoscopy.    -   Fecal occult blood test : A test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. A small amount of stool is placed on a special card or in a special container. A lab tests the stool sample and sends the results to the doctor. Blood in the stool may be a sign of polyps, cancer, or other conditions. This test is also called a guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT).    -  Fecal immunochemical test (FIT): A test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that is hidden in the sample and cannot be seen with the naked eye. Blood in the stool may be a sign of polyps, cancer, or other conditions.     -  Colonography (virtual colonoscopy): A test that uses a CT scan to take pictures of the inside of the colon and rectum. The pictures are made into a video screen picture. If there is anything abnormal, a colonoscopy may be done to remove polyps or tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.     -  Double-contrast barium enema: A series of x-rays of the colon and rectum. For the x-rays, air is put into the colon through the rectum and a small amount of liquid that contains barium is put into the rectum also through the colon. The barium coats the inside wall of the colon and x-rays are taken. This procedure is also called barium enema with air-contrast x-ray imaging, lower GI series, and lower gastrointestinal series.    -   Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam in which the doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. This procedure is also called a proctologic exam, and in men, it is sometimes done to check the prostate.

Colon cancer is cancer that forms in the tissues of the colon. Colon cancer and rectal cancer are often grouped together and called colorectal cancer, because they have many features in common. The colon is part of the body's digestive system. The digestive system breaks down food so the body can use it for energy and nourishment. After food is broken down, it passes through the small intestine. The small intestine is attached to the stomach on one end and to the colon on the other end. The undigested food then passes into the colon, the last part of the digestive system. The colon is a long muscular tube where vitamins and water are absorbed from the undigested food. The stool, left over waste, moves through the colon. The rectum is the last 5 to 6 inches of the large intestine, ending at the anus. Most cases of colorectal cancer begin as a growth called a polyp on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Some of these polyps turn into cancer over time (usually many years). Because colon cancer is one of the most common cancers, many studies have looked at factors that affect the prognosis and treatment options.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

The following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. An imaging technique which uses special x-ray equipment to make pictures of the brain and other organs in the body. An x-ray scanner linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of the brain and other parts of the body. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or CAT scanning.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This procedure is also called PET scan, PET imaging, and positron-emission tomography.    -   CEA assay: A test that measures the level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood. CEA is a substance released into the bloodstream by both cancer cells and normal cells. Some doctors use high levels of CEA as a tumor marker. This test is sometimes used to help diagnose colon cancer and cancers of the appendix, pancreas, lung, and breast. It is usually not helpful in people who smoke, because they usually have a higher level of CEA in their blood.     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.

Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if colon cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually colon cancer cells. The disease is metastatic colon cancer, not liver cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following stages are used for colon cancer:\\n                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) Colon Cancer    In stage 0 colon cancer, cancer is found only in the innermost lining of the colon.     Stage I Colon Cancer     In stage I colon cancer, cancer has spread through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa and/or into the muscle layer.       Stage II Colon Cancer    Stage II colon cancer is divided into the following:            - Stage IIA: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer into the subserosa, or into tissues surrounding the colon.      - Stage IIB: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer into tissues surrounding the colon and has grown into or attached to nearby organs or structures.      - Stage IIC: Cancer has spread through the outermost layer of the colon and into nearby organs or structures.               Stage III Colon Cancer     Stage III colon cancer is divided into the following:            - Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread into the submucosa, and/or into the muscle layer of the colon wall and into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes.      - Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer into tissues surrounding the colon and into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, or has spread into the submucosa and/or into the muscle layer of the colon wall and through the outermost layers of the colon wall. Cancer may also have spread to 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes.      - Stage IIIC: Cancer may have spread through different layers of the colon wall, through the outermost layers of the colon wall, or into nearby organs or tissues. Cancer has spread to 4 or more nearby lymph nodes.              Stage IV Colon Cancer     In stage IV colon cancer, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lungs. This stage is also called advanced or metastatic cancer.       Recurrent Colon Cancer    Recurrent colon cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the colon or in other parts of the body.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Five types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages colon cancer. Surgery for colon cancer may include the following:            -  Colectomy: A surgical procedure to remove all or part of the colon. If the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, they are also removed. Cancer in the ascending, transverse, or descending colon may be removed by an open colectomy or a laparoscopic colectomy.    - If cancer is small and in an early stage, a laparoscopic colectomy may be used to remove the cancer and part of the colon wall.      -  Partial colectomy with anastomosis: A surgical procedure to remove the cancer and part of the healthy colon, along with nearby lymph nodes, followed by joining the two parts of the colon back together. Also called a colectomy.    -  Colectomy with colostomy: A surgical procedure to remove the cancer and create an opening (stoma) from the large intestine through the abdominal wall by cutting through the abdominal muscles. A bag is attached to the stoma to collect stool. Colon cancer surgery may be done if needed to relieve or prevent problems caused by the cancer, even if there are too few healthy cells to remain in the body after surgery. This is called palliative surgery and may be done as open surgery or laparoscopically. Palliative surgery does not cure and is not a treatment for colon cancer.               Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor. Treatment given to shrink a tumor before the main treatment is given is called neoadjuvant therapy.       Radiation Therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where it is in the body. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat colon cancer.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).       The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.             -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer is given before surgical removal of the tumor.     -  Adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer is given after surgical removal of the tumor.    -  Systemic chemotherapy for colon cancer is given to destroy cancer cells that may remain after surgery or to lessen the chance that the cancer will come back. It is also used to control or kill cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body.

When removed by surgery, the cancer may come back. Sometimes new tumors form in the colon; this is not the same as the cancer coming back. People who have had colon cancer have an increased risk of developing another colon cancer years later. It is important for them to have follow-up tests as directed by their doctor. Treatments given for colon cancer may also cause side effects years after the treatment has ended.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages of colon cancer. Surgery may also be used to relieve or prevent obstruction of the colon or bleeding. Types of surgery include the following:            -  Polypectomy and local excision: If cancer is found in a polyp and has not spread to other areas, the polyp may be removed during a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy (polypectomy). If the whole polyp cannot be removed or if cells in the polyp are very abnormal, a local excision may be done to remove the cancer and a small amount of the healthy tissue around it. If cells in the polyp may have spread into the wall of the colon, part of the colon or rectum may be removed. This is called a colectomy.      -  Colectomy: Surgery to remove a part of the colon and reconnect the healthy parts. Most patients can have their intestines reconnected. Sometimes a colostomy is done instead (see below). A colectomy may be done to:                  - diagnose colon cancer;       - take out the colon cancer that is causing bleeding or blocking the colon and relieve symptoms, such as pain, bowel blockage, or bleeding; and/or       - prevent cancer in patients who have certain diseases of the colon, such as hereditary disorders or a history of polyps.                  - Colectomy with colostomy: If the cancer cannot be completely removed or the intestine cannot be reconnected, part of the large intestine is attached to an opening made in the outside wall of the abdomen and waste material passes through into a special bag. This is called a colostomy. If a colostomy is done, most of the colon will have been removed along with the cancer. The colostomy may be temporary or permanent. If it is temporary, an operation may be done later to reconnect the colon and close the colostomy.            Watchful waiting, a treatment plan in which patients are closely monitored, may be followed instead of immediate treatment such as surgery for a tumor less than 1 centimeter in size.     Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:           -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat colon cancer, especially when the cancer has spread to areas beyond the colon. It may also be used to relieve symptoms such as pain.

When cancer has spread to other parts of the body, surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. In stage I, cancer cells have spread beyond the innermost layer of the colon into other layers of the colon wall, but have not spread outside the colon wall to nearby organs or tissues, or the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Surgery for stage I colon cancer is usually a colectomy with removal of lymph nodes near the colon.    A colectomy may be followed by end-to-end anastomosis, a surgical procedure that joins two loops of the colon together. In some cases, part of the colon is connected to the abdominal wall and waste matter is emptied into a disposable bag. This procedure is called a colostomy. Small skin bags or self-sealing plastic bags also may be used for a colostomy. A colostomy may be temporary or permanent.       Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Laparoscopic surgery      Laparoscopic surgery is a technique to remove the colon cancer using many small abdominal surgical cuts as compared to the open approach performed by a surgeon through one large cut to the abdomen. Laparoscopic surgery has generally been used for earlier stage colon cancer, but may be used for later stage cancer for which neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) is used. Laparoscopic colectomy may result in less pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and a faster return to normal activities, compared to open resection of the colon.         Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug.       In colon cancer, chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove, or to shrink tumors that have spread to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy given before surgery to shrink a tumor is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    In advanced cancer, combination chemotherapy may be used to relieve symptoms caused by the cancer. Treatment given to ease a baby's symptoms caused by advanced cancer in a pregnant woman may include drug therapy commonly used to treat the mother.      See Drugs Approved for Colon Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are three types of standard treatment:         - Surgery     - Chemotherapy     - Radiation therapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - Immunotherapy        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three types of standard treatment.\\n                    Three types of treatment are used:         Surgery    -  Surgery to remove the cancer and nearby lymph nodes is usually done when the cancer is found. For stage 1 and stage 2 colon cancer, this may be the only treatment.     - If the patient is too sick to have the cancer removal surgery, another type of surgery may be done to relieve the symptoms of cancer. This may include placing a stent or a colostomy.           Colostomy: An operation that creates an opening from the colon to the surface of the abdomen and allows feces to pass out of the body into a colostomy bag.    -  Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection is a surgery to remove the cancer through several small incisions. A laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a camera) is inserted through one of the incisions and used to guide the surgery. The patient may have a quicker recovery and the scar is smaller than in surgery done through a large incision. However, it has not been proven that this type of surgery is as good as surgery done through a larger incision.    -  Sometimes cancer that has spread cannot be completely removed by surgery. Using a procedure called radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cancer may be killed by heating it with an electronic probe through small incisions in the abdomen. Other procedures localize treatment and may include heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. These treatments are being studied for stage 4 colon cancer and peritoneal metastases.           Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Colorectal Cancer for more information.     Different chemotherapy drugs and combinations of drugs are used in different situations. Doctors sometimes give chemotherapy before therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, or hyperthermia in order to shrink the tumor. This is called neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy given after surgery, or to help stop the disease from coming back, is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Sometimes chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given at the same time.    Even when chemotherapy does not cure colon cancer, it may still help to relieve symptoms such as pain. Treatment given to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life is called palliative therapy.     See Drugs Approved for Colorectal Cancer and Treatment Options for Colon Cancer, by Stage, for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether it is palliative or curative. External radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms such as obstruction, bleeding, or pain. It may also be used to treat colon cancer that cannot be removed by surgery in rare cases. When radiation therapy is used with curative intent, it is more often in the treatment of rectal cancer.

Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.

In the United States, cancer of the colon and cancer of the rectum are often grouped together and called colorectal cancer. However, treatments for colon cancer and rectal cancer may be different, so it is important to know whether the cancer is in the colon or the rectum. This summary is about rectal cancer. (See the PDQ summary on Colorectal Cancer Screening for information about screening and testing for colorectal cancer and the PDQ treatment summary on Colon Cancer Treatment for information about treating colon cancer.)   Most rectal cancers begin as a growth called an adenomatous polyp (adenoma) on the inner lining of the rectum. Some types of polyps can change into cancer. Polyps may be small and produce few, if any, symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to find polyps before they become cancer. Polyps that are removed during colorectal cancer screening can be examined under a microscope to check for cancer. Over time, some polyps become cancer. A polyp must be removed completely to keep all the cancer cells from being left behind. Removing polyps also helps prevent colorectal cancer.   Rectal cancer is a disease that usually affects older adults, but can occur at any age. (See the PDQ summary on Colorectal Cancer Prevention for information about reducing the risk of this cancer.)\\n                \\n                \\n                    The exact cause of rectal cancer is unknown.\\n                    Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor about your risk of cancer. Risk factors for rectal cancer include the following:         - Personal or family history of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer.    - Chronic (long-term) inflammatory diseases of the colon such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.    -  Certain inherited syndromes that are passed through families, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome).    - A diet high in red or processed meats.    - Personal history of breast, uterus, or ovarian cancer.    - Physical inactivity.    - Older age.    -     African-American race.        Although alcoholic drinks have been shown to increase the risk of several types of cancer, there have been mixed results in studies looking at the risk of colorectal cancer and alcohol use. Some studies have shown an increased risk and others no increased risk. Studies of the relationship between tobacco use and colorectal cancer have also had mixed results. Some studies have found a slightly increased risk and others have found no increased risk.   Medicines, especially aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer. However, these drugs have side effects and are not currently recommended as a way to prevent colorectal cancer in people who have an average risk for this disease. Doctors may, however, prescribe these drugs to registered FAP patients and may advise people with Lynch syndrome to take aspirin to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

A few of the tests used to screen for colon cancer are listed below. Talk with your doctor about the screening tests that are best for you.   A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT):  A test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. Blood in the stool may be a sign of a polyp or cancer. Other conditions, such as hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, and colitis, can cause bleeding and may also affect the results of the FOBT or FIT.

Risk factors for rectal cancer include the following:          Inherited syndromes: Certain inherited syndromes may increase the risk of rectal cancer, including the following:         -  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): The risk of colorectal cancer is increased if colon polyps begin forming before the age of 40.    -  Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP): A type of FAP and a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. AFAP is also called attenuated FAP, proximal polyposis of the colon, and right-sided FAP.    -  MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP): A hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome caused by changes (mutations) in the MUTYH gene. The risk of developing adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer is increased. Individuals with MAP may also be at risk for developing other types of cancer, including cancer of the stomach, small intestine, ovary, bladder, thyroid, uterus, breast, and bone cancer called Ewing's sarcoma.    -  Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS): A hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome that also increases the risk of cancer of the stomach, small intestine, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, testicles, and uterus.    -  Familial juvenile polyposis (FJP): A colorectal cancer syndrome that begins with the growth of juvenile polyps in the colon and rectum. The risk of colorectal cancer is increased for patients with more than three juvenile polyps or a family history of colorectal cancer.    -  Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer) (HNPCC): An inherited disorder that increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon, rectum, endometrium, and ovary.    -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome: A hereditary cancer syndrome that greatly increases the risk of developing several types of cancer, particularly in children and young adults, including cancer of the colon.    -  Juvenile polyposis syndrome: A hereditary cancer syndrome that greatly increases the risk of colon cancer. It is caused by mutations in the BMPR1A gene, SMAD4 gene, and other genes not yet identified. Colon cancer risk is also increased with the following inherited conditions:         -  Muir-Torre syndrome: A hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome that also increases the risk of cancers of the endometrium, kidney, ureter, heart, and thyroid.    -  Cowden syndrome, also called multiple hamartoma syndrome: A disorder that is characterized by multiple noncancerous, tumor-like growths called hamartomas and an increased risk of cancers, including cancer of the colon.    -  Turcot syndrome: A hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome that can also increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors.    -  Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome: A disorder that is characterized by macrocephaly (large head size), intestinal polyposis, lipomas (benign fatty tumors), and pigmented macules of the penis.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) FAP is an inherited disorder in which many polyps (more than 100) form in the colon and rectum during the teenage years. Most of these polyps become cancer, if the colon is not removed, usually before 40 years of age. FAP is discussed in more detail in the \\\"Having an inherited disorder that increases the risk of rectal cancer\\\" section of this summary.     Gardner syndrome Gardner syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) that includes many extra growths in the body as well as many polyps (more than 100) that form in the colon and rectum during the teenage years. Most of these polyps become cancer, if the colon is not removed, usually before 40 years of age.     Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (in the colon) In ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the tissue that lines the inside of the colon becomes inflamed (red and swollen). Over time, healthy tissue is replaced by inflamed tissue, and ulcers (sores) may form. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are discussed in more detail in the \\\"Having polyps, colon cancer, or conditions of the large intestine that increase the risk of rectal cancer\\\" section of this summary.     MUTYH-associated polyposis MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an inherited disorder in which many polyps (more than 20) form in the colon and rectum. Most of these polyps become cancer, if the colon is not removed. MAP is discussed in more detail in the \\\"Having an inherited disorder that increases the risk of rectal cancer\\\" section of this summary.     Peutz-Jeghers syndrome Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an inherited disorder that is characterized by the development of benign growths called hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and dark freckles on the skin. It is also in this section because most cancers that form in people with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome form in the GI tract. The polyps in the GI tract may be uncommon blood vessels, and the polyps are most often found in the small intestine (the part of the digestive tract that runs between the stomach and the colon). Less common are polyps in the colon and rectum. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is discussed in more detail in the \\\"Having an inherited disorder that increases the risk of rectal cancer\\\" section of this summary.     Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer or HNPCC) Persons with inherited Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers. Lynch syndrome is caused by an inherited change (mutation) in a mismatch repair gene. Lynch syndrome is associated with fewer than 100 polyps in the colon and rectum. Polyps in these patients are more likely to develop into cancer, often at a young age. This may be because polyps in these patients usually have more than one mutation (genetic change).   Surveillance, including yearly colonoscopy to check for polyps in the colon or rectum, is recommended for persons who have any of the above diseases or syndromes.

Besides these tests, certain imaging tests are used to find out if the cancer has spread.    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look inside the colon and rectum for polyps, abnormal areas, and cancer. A colonoscope is inserted through the anus into the rectum and colon. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Colon polyps are sometimes removed during a colonoscopy. The tissue removed is viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy is rarely done if there is clearly a cancer that can be removed during surgery.    -   Barium enema x-ray : A series of x-rays of the colon and rectum. Patients either swallow a barium solution or get an enema with barium, which coats the intestine. Then x-rays are taken. The barium makes colon and rectum abnormalities easier to see. A double-contrast barium enema is a two-step x-ray exam of the colon and rectum. In the first step, a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound) is inserted into the rectum. The barium coats the lining of the colon and rectum. In the second step, a small amount of air is inserted into the rectum and the barium coating is viewed with x-rays. A double-contrast barium enema may be used to find ulcerative colitis and rectal cancer and polyps that can lead to cancer.    -   Anoscopy : An anoscope is used to view and examine the lining of the anus, anal canal, and lower rectum. The anoscope is a short, hollow, tube-like instrument with a light on the end. It is inserted through the anus and into the anal canal and the lower part of the rectum.    -   Flexible sigmoidoscopy : A procedure used to see inside the sigmoid colon and rectum to check for abnormal areas. A sigmoidoscope is inserted through the anus and into the sigmoid colon. A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.

The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for anything abnormal, such as a mass.    -   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay : A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is a substance made in the body, usually at very low levels. Higher than normal amounts of CEA may be released into the bloodstream by both cancerous and noncancerous conditions. A CEA test is often done after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer to find out the amount of CEA in the blood; CEA levels are sometimes higher in patients with more advanced stages of colorectal cancer. If the level of CEA blood is high, other tests may be done to see whether the cancer has spread.    -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look at the inner surface of the colon and rectum. A colonoscopy may be done to look for signs of cancer if a DRE suggests something abnormal. This procedure is also called total colonoscopy.

The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This procedure is also called a positron emission tomography scan. When used to diagnose colorectal cancer, this imaging procedure is often called PET/CT.    -   X-ray: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.

Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. It may be used to help diagnose cancer and plan treatment. These levels may be higher than normal if cancer is present. Some tumor markers are also used to see how well the body responds to a treatment. This test measures the level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood. High levels of CEA can be found in patients with colorectal cancer.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look at the inner lining of the colon and rectum for any abnormal areas. A colonoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted through the anus and into the rectum and colon. A tiny video camera at the end of the tube sends images to a monitor. To remove tissue samples, another tool is passed through the colonoscope. Any tissue that looks abnormal is removed through the colonoscope and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

Screening tests are used to look for cancer in people who have no signs of cancer. Several of the screening tests used can also help prevent colorectal cancer by removing polyps (abnormal growths) before they turn into cancer. Other tests can help both detect and diagnose colorectal cancer. All of these tests are described below. If abnormal tissue, such as polyps, is found during any of the screening tests, samples of the tissue are cut out and then viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. This procedure is called a biopsy. For a biopsy, the doctor removes cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If a biopsy is not done at the same time as a screening or diagnostic test, a separate office visit will be needed.     The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Digital rectal exam (DRE): A digital rectal exam is a physical exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse practitioner inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the colon to feel for polyps, any abnormal areas, or cancer.    -   Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): A test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope. Blood in the stool may be a sign of a problem in the colon or rectum. Having blood in the stool does not always mean there is cancer. Doctors may suggest patients use a 3-sample fecal occult blood test over a week or two. If the samples take at home, the patient is asked to collect the stool on 3 separate days, take it to the family's health care provider's office, and then the health care provider sends it to a laboratory. If the samples are done in the doctor's office or other health care setting, patients will be asked for the stool that is passed during 3 separate bowel movements.      -   Colonoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer.

Even when rectal cancer has been cured, there is a chance it will come back. Treatment of rectal cancer may damage the rectum and nearby tissues. Patients who have had treatment for rectal cancer need to be followed closely by their doctors.    Rectal cancer is stage 0, I, II, III, or IV depending on how far the cancer has spread. For stage 0 rectal cancer, there is no cancer in lymph nodes and the cancer has not spread to nearby tissue.                      If untreated, most rectal polyps will become cancerous.Rectal polyps are growths on the inside lining of the rectum. They are relatively common in adults over age 50. Regular screening is important because rectal polyps can turn into cancer and be life-threatening. However, not all polyps turn into cancer. In most patients, polyps that become cancer usually are larger than 1 centimeter (cm) and have a certain tissue pattern seen under a microscope called tubular villous or villous adenoma. Polyps can be cancer, too.   Polyps often do not cause any signs or symptoms. Doctors find most rectal polyps during screening tests for colorectal cancer. Because there is a risk that polyps return, follow-up checking (surveillance) is often needed for life.    Some rectal polyps are flat (sessile) and spread across the surface of the rectum lining, while other rectal polyps hang from the surface of the rectum by a stalk (pedunculated). A person can have one or more than one polyp at a time. If a person has more than 20 polyps, there is an increased risk that polyps will form in the rest of the colon.    Types of polyps include:            -   Adenomatous polyps: These polyps may turn into cancer and are called adenomas. Adenomatous polyps are most often removed during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.    -   Hyperplastic polyps: These polyps usually are not precancerous.    -   Inflammatory polyps: These polyps may form up to 8 years after a person has had ulcerative colitis.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

See the General Information section of this summary.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT Colonography : A procedure to look inside the colon and rectum for polyps (abnormal growths) or other abnormalities using x-rays and computers. Pictures of the inside of the colon and rectum are made by a computer connected to an x-ray machine. This procedure is also called virtual colonoscopy, because the pictures create a very clear view, much like a colonoscopy.    -   ERUS  (endorectal ultrasound): An ultrasound procedure used to see inside the rectum and nearby organs. An endoscope is inserted into the rectum and sends out sound waves that bounce off tissues inside the body and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of any tumor that is present and nearby organs on a monitor. Also called transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).    -   Exploratory laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. An incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (thin, lighted tube) is inserted into the abdomen. Other small incisions may be made and special instruments may be used to move organs and tissues aside so the doctor can get a better view.    -   MRI  (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells. If there is any glucose uptake in the liver and at the site of the tumor, a biopsy is done to see if there are cancer cells.         The results of the tests and procedures used to diagnose rectal cancer are also used to stage the disease.    The following stages are used for rectal cancer:         -   Stage 0  (carcinoma in situ): The cancer is found only in the mucosa, or innermost layer of cells of the rectum.    -   Stage I : Cancer has formed in the mucosa and has spread into the wall of the rectum.     -   Stage II : Cancer has spread through the wall of the rectum.    -   Stage III : Cancer has spread through the wall of the rectum and to nearby lymph nodes.    -   Stage IV : Cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the liver or lungs.          The following stages are used for recurrent rectal cancer:         -   Recurrent rectal cancer can occur in the pelvis (in the same place as the original tumor or near the original tumor) or in other parts of the body. This can be difficult to cure and may cause signs or symptoms. Treatment is used to help relieve these signs and symptoms and improve quality of life. The purpose of treatment is to try to totally remove the cancer if possible.      - For recurrent rectal cancer that occurs in other parts of the body, the cancer may spread to the lungs or, less often, to the liver, brain, bone, or other parts of the body\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.

Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if rectal cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually rectal cancer cells.

An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -  Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is a substance made by cancer cells and by some normal cells. After rectal cancer has been diagnosed, a test for CEA is done to provide a baseline (beginning) measurement. It may be checked often during and after treatment. If the levels of CEA go up, it may be a sign the cancer is growing. If the levels of CEA go down, it may be a sign the treatment is working. Sometimes the levels of CEA are high even though there is no cancer.     -   Colonoscopy: A procedure to look at the inner linings of the large intestine (rectum and colon). A colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. The colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It also has a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.     -   EUS (endorectal ultrasound): A procedure in which an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.

An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               -  The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.     - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   CEA assay: A test that measures the level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, a substance found in higher than usual amounts in cancer cells, the cells lining the colon and rectum, and during fetal development) in blood. A blood sample is needed. A higher than normal CEA level may mean that colorectal cancer has spread.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue.

The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   EUS (endorectal ultrasound): A procedure in which an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs, such as the rectum or nearby lymph nodes, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of these tissues or organs on a monitor. This procedure is also called endorectal sonography.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if rectal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rectal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic rectal cancer, not lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Stages of cancer are generally from stage 0 to stage IV.\\n                    The stages of cancer indicate the formation of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. Stage 0 is the earliest stage. In stage 0, the abnormal cells are only in the inner lining of the rectum. In stages I, II, III, and IV, the cancer is invasive, which means that the cancer has grown into, or spread to, the nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or organs.         The stages of cancer are based on certain factors, including whether the cancer has spread from where it first developed to other parts of the body.

Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed in the innermost layers of the rectum and has spread into the second and third layers or into the muscle layer.       Stage IIA    In stage IIA, cancer has spread into the outermost layers of the rectum.

One type of local excision therapy is called transanal endoscopic microsurgery.    -  Low anterior resection (LAR): Surgery to remove the cancer and part of or the entire rectum. If only part of the rectum is removed, the remaining part may be reattached directly to the colon or may be attached to a stoma. If a stoma is created, waste moves through an opening in the abdomen into a bag. If the cancer is low in the rectum, additional healthy tissue may be removed to lower the chance the cancer will come back.     -  Abdominoperineal resection (APR): Surgery to remove the anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon through an incision made in the abdomen and another made between the genitals and anus (perineum). The doctor may also remove nearby lymph nodes. After the cancer, anus, and rectum are removed, the colon is pulled through an opening made in the abdomen and sewn to the skin. Waste moves through this opening into a bag and is collected there.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients with stage II or stage III rectal cancer usually have radiation therapy and chemotherapy before or after surgery.\\n                    When radiation therapy and chemotherapy are given before surgery, it is called neoadjuvant therapy.

In a polypectomy, the polyp is removed and the area of the intestine where the polyp was attached is also removed. Sometimes needle localization is used to help the surgeon remove very small tumors. In needle localization, the surgeon inserts a thin needle into the abnormal tissue and then removes the needle along with the abnormal tissue. With a local excision, the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it are removed using one of the following procedures:            -  Transanal excision.     -  Transmural resection.     -  Trans-sacral resection.     -  Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).

One of the following types of surgery may be used for rectal cancer:            -  Polypectomy or local excision: For very small rectal cancers that are found early, a polypectomy or local excision may be used to remove the cancer.    -  Resection: Only certain areas of the rectum or nearby tissues that contain cancer and a small healthy margin around them are removed. This may also include removal of nearby lymph nodes that contain cancer.     -  Resection and anastomosis: The piece of the body part that contains the cancer and a small healthy margin around it is removed. The two healthy ends are attached back together.     -  Abdominoperineal resection: The surgeon removes the sigmoid colon, the entire rectum, and the anus. An incision is made in the abdomen. A colostomy is made to attach the remaining colon to an opening (stoma) made on the wall of the abdomen so that stool is passed out of the body into a disposable bag.    -  Lymph node dissection: The surgeon may remove lymph nodes, growing from the main node center around the intestines, to make tumor resection easier. This is called a lymph node dissection. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are found throughout the body.

A surgical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery. The procedure used to remove the cancer depends on the size of the tumor and the area of the rectum affected. Different types of surgery used to treat rectal cancer include the following:          -  Local excision: If the tumor is small and has not spread beyond the rectum, a local excision may be done. Surgery to remove the tumor and part of the lining of the rectal wall is done without cutting through the skin. How the surgery is done depends on where the tumor is in the rectum. The following procedures are types of local excision:                -   Transanal excision: Removal of a tumor in the rectum using instruments inserted through the anus.      -  Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: Surgery to remove tumors from the inside of the rectum through the anus using a specialized video camera and surgical instruments.       -    Transsacral local resection: Surgery to remove a tumor in the middle or lower part of the rectum through an incision (cut) made over the tailbone on the back. It is also called Kraske procedure.       -  Local polypectomy: Removal of polyps or tumors and some surrounding healthy tissue during a colonoscopy, without cutting through the skin.               - If the tumor is close to the anus, a colostomy may need to be done. A colostomy is an opening in the wall of the abdomen created during surgery. The end of the large intestine is brought out through the opening to form a stoma. An ostomy bag is attached to the abdominal wall to collect stool. This may be a temporary or permanent colostomy.            -  Resection: Surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum. The healthy parts of the intestine are sewn together. Resection may include the following:                -   Low anterior resection: Surgery to remove a part of the rectum. Part of the remaining rectum is joined to the remaining colon.       -   Abdominal perineal resection: Surgery to remove a part of the rectum or the entire rectum and anus. The remaining colon is then attached to an opening in the abdominal wall, where a colostomy bag is attached to collect stool. This procedure is done when a permanent colostomy is needed.                Resection surgery may also be done using one of the following methods:                -    Laparoscopic surgery: A surgical procedure to remove the tumor from the rectum using several small incisions (cuts) in the abdomen. A laparoscope (a thin tube with a light and a video camera) and surgical instruments are inserted through the incisions to remove the tumor. The laparoscope sends a magnified image from inside the body to a monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view.       -   Cryosurgery: The use of an instrument to freeze and destroy tumor cells. The instrument may be placed on the surface of the body or inserted into a body opening. In rectal cancer, a needle is inserted through the abdomen into the tumor and liquid nitrogen or argon gas is moved through the needle to freeze the tissue. During the same procedure, the frozen tissue is allowed to thaw and then refrozen. This cycle of freezing and thawing is repeated three to four times. Cryosurgery may be used to treat early-stage cancer, to reduce signs and symptoms caused by tumor cells, or when radiation therapy cannot be used.

Surgery is the most common treatment.  Patients may have other treatments before surgery, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. This is called neoadjuvant treatment. Treating the cancer before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue taken during surgery or the need for surgery.    Patients may also have other treatments after surgery, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. This is called adjuvant treatment. Treating the cancer after surgery helps lower the risk that the cancer will come back by destroying any cancer cells that are left. Patients who receive adjuvant therapy are also followed closely for years by the health care team.     Even when rectal cancer is being treated with surgery, it is common for the cancer to spread to distant parts of the body. The doctor uses a combination of treatments for rectal cancer that has spread to improve the quality of life and lengthen survival. When this is not possible, treatment may focus on the relief of symptoms, improving quality of life, and lengthening survival.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Four treatment methods are used:\\n                    Surgery    Surgery for rectal cancer may include the following:             -  Local excision: Surgery to remove the tumor without removing surrounding tissue, including organs. A doctor inserts a surgical instrument through the anus and removes the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. The doctor may also insert a small tube with a light and camera for viewing the inside of the anus. This tube is called a proctoscope. If cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes, a small amount of intestine may be removed and reattached. This procedure is called a local excision. For tumors near the anus, if the doctor cannot completely remove the tumor or there is an increased risk of the tumor coming back, additional treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy will be done.   -  Low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis: A low anterior resection is done when cancer is in the rectum but does not involve the anus. An incision (cut) is made in the abdomen (laparotomy). The part of the rectum containing the cancer is removed. If the doctor removes the anus and at least part of the rectum, the large intestine can be joined (anastomosed) to the anus. The patient uses the anus to expel wastes. The doctor also removes nearby lymph nodes. This procedure is also called colorectal resection.   -  Abdominoperineal resection: Surgery done when the cancer has spread to the anus. An incision is made in the abdomen (laparotomy), and the anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon are removed. This operation leaves only the large intestine leading to the anus. To allow stool to leave the body, the surgeon brings one end of the remaining large intestine through an opening made in the wall of the abdomen. A sterile bag is attached to the opening to collect stool and is known as a colostomy bag. The area where the opening is made is called a stoma.. The doctor also removes nearby lymph nodes. The patient breathes through a breathing tube while under general anesthesia (medicine to put a patient to sleep and keep the patient unaware during surgery). A team of surgeons, ostomy nurses, and enterostomal therapists work with the patients to decide the site of the stoma and make sure they understand how to care for it after surgery. Stoma sites are chosen so that clothing will cover them.

A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.

If the cancer has not spread outside the rectum, surgery may be the only treatment needed. If the cancer has spread, removing the cancer will help lessen symptoms such as bleeding, pain, or blockage.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:.            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.     The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and whether it has spread. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat rectal cancer. External radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis may affect an unborn baby. For this reason, women who are pregnant should not have this treatment.   Radiation therapy may work better in rectal tissue if chemotherapy is given at the same time.

The majority of colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas, which are cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids.   Cancer may also be found in polyps, which are abnormal growths that form in the lining of the colon and rectum. Polyps that develop into cancer are called adenomatous polyps or adenomas. Not all polyps are adenomas. Some types of polyps do not become cancer.

Twenty to thirty years can pass before cancer cells from polyps form. Screening is used to find and remove polyps before they turn into cancer, and to find cancer early. Early colorectal cancer is easier to cure than cancer that is found after it has spread. Screening for colorectal cancer by a doctor or other health care professional should start at age 50 unless there is a family history of colorectal cancer or there are signs or symptoms.    There are three types of screening tests for polyps and colorectal cancer. One type of test checks for signs of cancer in a sample of stool (fecal). A second type of test checks for polyps and cancer in the colon and rectum. A third type of test is a virtual colonoscopy, which uses x-rays to make pictures of the colon and rectum. Each type of test has risks and benefits. Talk to your doctor about the screening tests best for you.   The American Cancer Society recommends that people at average risk of colorectal cancer begin regular screening at age 50. People at increased or high risk should talk to their doctor about beginning screening tests at an earlier age or having them done more frequently.

The large intestine is part of the digestive system. The digestive system takes in nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from food and gives them to the body. The digestive system also gets rid of solid wastes. Wastes move through the large intestine and leave the body through the rectum and the anus.    The walls of the colon and rectum have several layers of tissue. Most colorectal cancers begin in the innermost layer (mucosal layer) of the colon or rectum and grow into the middle layers. Cancer cells can grow through the wall of the large intestine to invade or damage nearby organs and tissues. Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n                    Some colon or rectal polyps can change into cancer.\\n                    A polyp is a growth on the inside lining of the colon or rectum. Polyps may be flat or raised slightly above the surface of the colon lining and also may be attached to the large intestine by a stalk.   There are two types of polyps:         - Hyperplastic polyps and inflammatory polyps, which are common and are not cancerous.    - Adenomatous polyps, which are also common, but may turn into cancer. Adenomatous polyps are sometimes called adenomas.          It is not always possible to tell whether a polyp is adenomatous just by looking at it. For this reason, adenomatous polyps and other polyps that are not clearly hyperplastic are usually removed.    Most colorectal cancers begin as a growth on the inner lining of the large intestine. Over time some of these growths become colorectal cancers. If polyps are removed before they become cancer, colorectal cancer may be prevented.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Tests to detect (find) and diagnose colorectal cancer are used in screening and diagnosis.\\n                    Screening is done to find colorectal cancer in people who have no symptoms. Diagnostic tests are done to find out the source of a problem, such as cancer, when signs or symptoms are present.    Screening tests used to detect (find) and diagnose colorectal cancer include:         -  Colonoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum and the entire colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A colonoscopy is a type of endoscopy. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.     -  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): A test to check the stool (solid waste) for blood that is hidden (occult). Small samples of stool are put on special cards and returned to the doctor or lab for testing. Because of the low risk and ease of the test, it is often used in screening. Having blood in the stool may be a sign of a polyp or cancer. Other conditions, such as hemorrhoids and certain foods, may also cause bleeding. If there is blood in the stool, a test called a colonoscopy will be done.    -  Sigmoidoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum and the lower third of the colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A tube is inserted through the anus into the rectum and the lower colon. The tube used for sigmoidoscopy is thinner than the one used for a colonoscopy. It also does not examine the entire colon.

The digestive system removes and processes food, sends nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins) to the blood, and removes waste from the body as stool (solid waste).    Most colorectal cancers begin as a growth, called a polyp, inside the colon or rectum. Some types of polyps can change into cancer. In general, the longer a polyp is in the colon or rectum, the more likely it is to become cancer. Polyps may be small and produce few, if any, symptoms. For this reason, doctors may recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Screening tests also help find colorectal cancer early, when it is likely to be easier to treat.    Signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer include blood in the stool and a change in bowel habits. These signs and symptoms may be caused by colorectal cancer or by other conditions. If you have any of these signs or symptoms, check with your doctor.    Polyps and cancers in the colon and rectum can often be seen during an exam of the inside of the colon and rectum.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells may break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the blood or lymph system to other parts of the body.   Bones, lungs, and liver are the sites most often affected by metastatic colorectal cancer. The cancer cells in metastatic colorectal cancer are the same type of cells as those that were originally in the colon or rectum. For example, if colorectal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually colorectal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic colorectal cancer, not lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The risk of many types of cancer can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and being physically active.\\n                    For cancer prevention, a person should take the following actions: Not use tobacco products or make plans to stop using them. Tobacco products raise the risk of many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. If you want to quit using tobacco products and need help, you may call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) or contact www.smokefree.gov for information and support.    Choose a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamins and nutrients that may help lower cancer risk. Try to eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day.    Maintain your correct weight for your height. Overweight and obese people are at a slightly higher risk for developing colorectal cancer compared to people at a healthy weight.    Be physically active. Adults should get 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) or more of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, every week. Children and teens should get 1 hour (60 minutes) or more of physical activity every day, and should include strengthening exercises on at least three days a week. Regular exercise helps lower the risk of many types of cancer.    Women may want to discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy (using birth control pills and postmenopausal hormones) with their doctor.    Certain medicines may help lower the risk of some types of cancer. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) lower the chance of getting colon polyps and of the polyps turning into cancer. The medicines also lower the chance of getting cancer in the rectum. However, there are risks of taking these medicines. These risks may be greater than the benefits in some people. If you want to take these medicines to lower your risk of colorectal cancer, discuss this with your doctor.    For more information about the steps you can take to lower your risk of cancer, see the Prevention section of the PDQ summary on Cancer Prevention.

Colorectal cancer begins most often from adenomatous polyps, which are benign (not cancerous) growths that form on the inside of the colon or rectum. Over time some of these polyps can become cancer and start to grow into the wall of the colon and rectum. Usually, it takes many years for normal tissue in the colon and rectum to change into a polyp and then into cancer, which means finding and removing polyps can prevent cancer from forming. Common symptoms of colorectal cancer include blood in or on your stool, a change in bowel habits, abdominal discomfort, weakness or fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. These symptoms can be caused by other conditions but if you have symptoms you think might be from cancer, see your doctor. Treatment options for colorectal cancer depend on several factors, including the stage of the cancer. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Colorectal cancer develops from a growth called a polyp.\\n                    The colorectal area is one of the few places in the body where doctors can look for and remove pre-cancerous growths (called polyps).

People with certain bowel diseases may also be at an increased risk. Anyone, however, can get colorectal cancer.    Death rates from colorectal cancer have been declining in the United States, but the trend is less pronounced in African Americans. One reason may be differences in screening rates.

The early detection and treatment of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, is called screening.    Most colorectal cancers start from polyps (abnormal growths in the colon or rectum) and may not cause signs or symptoms until they grow larger or there is bleeding. Screening tests may find polyps before they become cancer and can also find colorectal cancer early, when it is easier to treat.    The following tests and procedures may be used for colorectal cancer screening.     Fecal occult blood test (gFOBT or FOBT)    A test to check samples of feces (stool) for blood that cannot be seen by the naked eye. This test may be done on three samples of stool collected at home. Bleeding can be a sign of polyps or cancer. The fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) should not be confused with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT).    Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)    A test using antibodies to check for blood in the stool. This test is different than the fecal occult blood test (gFOBT).     Stool DNA test (sDNA)    A test done on a sample of stool to check for abnormal DNA from cancer or polyp cells. Sometimes stool DNA tests also check for blood in the stool.    Flexible sigmoidoscopy     A procedure in which a doctor inserts a short, thin, lighted tube into the rectum and looks at the rectum and lower third of the colon. If the doctor sees polyps or cancer, then a colonoscopy is done. A colonoscopy is like a flexible sigmoidoscopy, except that the doctor uses a longer tube to look at the rectum and entire colon. Other tests, such as a virtual colonoscopy or barium enema, are used in cases where a colonoscopy cannot be done. If needed, certain types of polyps can be removed during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.     Colonoscopy    A procedure in which a doctor uses a colonoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end) to look at the inside of the colon and rectum for polyps, abnormal areas, and cancer. A colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. If needed, certain types of polyps can be removed during this procedure. Colonoscopy is also called endoscopy of the colon, total colonoscopy, and lower GI endoscopy.     Double-contrast barium enema     A series of x-rays of the rectum and colon. For the x-rays, a contrast material (see below) is put into the rectum and allowed to flow through the colon. X-rays are taken as the material flows through. This procedure is also called a lower GI series. Sometimes cancer that is small or hiding behind folds in the colon may not be seen. The test may also cause polyps to be missed.

Screening for colorectal cancer may find polyps or cancer early, when treatment is most effective. Check the list to see if a colorectal cancer screening test is best done in a health care provider's office, at home, or at a special facility. Each colorectal cancer screening test may find different types of colon problems. Your health care provider will recommend the right screening test(s) for you. The screening schedule is the same for men and women.            At a health care provider's office     - DRE (digital rectal exam)  -  The health care provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for polyps or cancer.    - Sigmoidoscopy  -  The doctor uses a scope to look inside the rectum and lower third of the colon for polyps and cancer.    - CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy and air contrast barium enema)  -  A doctor uses special x-ray equipment to make a series of detailed pictures of the air-filled colon and rectum, and a computer combines the pictures into a view of the colon and rectum. For the CT scan part of the procedure, the patient lies on a table that slides through a scanner that takes the x-rays, which are sent to a computer. The procedure is also called virtual colonoscopy. For the air contrast barium enema, barium (a silver-white metallic compound) is put into the rectum through the anus. Barium coats the lining of the colon and rectum. Air is put into the colon through the anus to help barium coat the inner surface of the colon. Air contrast barium enema x-rays are taken of the colon and rectum.      At home     - Fecal occult blood test (FOBT)  -  A test that checks for blood in the stool. A health care provider or lab will examine the sample collected to see if there is blood in it. An FOBT can be done in your health care provider's office or at home. The home test requires collecting stool samples, following the instructions that come with the test kit, and mailing or taking them to the health care provider or lab.

SCREENING SAVED HER LIFE. She believes that being screened every 5 years starting at age 45 saved her life. Through regular screening, doctors found and removed a small tumor from her colon. Because the cancer was found early, Angela had a better chance of beating her cancer than if it had been found later.     Cancer screening usually involves a medical exam, blood tests, and imaging tests. For cancers that involve the body's surfaces (skin, breast, mouth, and colorectal), screening may also include looking at or through the surface for anything that seems abnormal. Tissue or cells that look abnormal are removed and checked under a microscope for cancer.     Screening tests for cancer are given to people with no symptoms. Symptoms are signs or changes in the body that may be caused by disease. If cancer screening finds an abnormal-looking area, you may need to have your tissues checked under a microscope to see whether cancer cells are present.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following tests and exams may also be used to find or check for colorectal cancer:\\n                    Physical exam and history      A physical exam of the body is done. The exam will focus on the breast, abdomen, and lymph nodes. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.        Genetic test     A test of a sample of blood, tissue, or body fluid is done to look for certain gene changes that increase the risk of colorectal cancer. If a genetic change is found and there is a high risk of cancer, measures to lower the risk and cancer screening may be done.        Stool tests     Stool tests check for signs of cancer in a sample of stool (feces). There are several types of stool tests:            -  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): A test that checks for hidden blood in the stool. An FOBT is not done if there is visible blood in the stool.     -  Fecal immunochemical test (FIT): A test that uses antibodies to check for hidden blood in the stool. An FIT is not done if there is visible blood in the stool.     -  Multitargeted stool DNA test (FIT-DNA): A test that uses a stool sample to check for misshapen cells or DNA and blood that is not visible (hidden) in the stool.      Colon and rectal cancers may bleed into the intestines. The blood may not be visible in the stool but it can be detected by microscopic tests. Bleeding can be caused by a number of non-cancerous diseases, so information from the history and physical exam and other tests are done to find out the cause of the bleeding.        Double-contrast barium enema      An x-ray exam called a double-contrast barium enema is done to check the inside of the colon and rectum for polyps, tumors, and other abnormal areas. Barium sulfate (a radiographic contrast medium) is placed in the rectum and fills the colon and rectum. Air is put in the colon and rectum to expand them. X-ray images are taken of the inside of the colon and rectum.        CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy)      CT colonography, also called virtual colonoscopy, is a procedure that uses a computer, a special x-ray machine (CT scanner), and a video monitor to show detailed images of the colon and rectum. A viewing tube is inserted into the rectum and images of the colon and rectum are taken.     Polyps and cancers are easier to find when the colon and rectum are completely empty.

From the results of many studies it appears that aspirin or drugs like aspirin (called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs) can lower the risk of polyps coming back in people who have already had them and of colorectal cancer in people who have not had them. However, there are potential risks, such as stomach bleeding, to taking aspirin regularly. It is not clear how long aspirin must be taken to lower risk, or what dose is best. Because of the possible risks, aspirin cannot be recommended for cancer prevention at this time. Patients should talk to their doctors about the risks and benefits of taking aspirin to lower the risk of colorectal cancer.     Achieve and maintain a healthy weight.    Being overweight or obese increases the risk of getting and dying from colorectal cancer.     Get regular physical activity.    People who participate in regular physical activity are at lower risk of getting and dying from colorectal cancer. It is not clear whether all types of physical activity are helpful. However, there is strong evidence that recreational activities such as walking and swimming can help lower the risk.     Choose a healthy diet.    A diet that includes a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help lower the risk of colorectal cancer. Avoiding large quantities of red and processed meats may also be helpful. The evidence about high-fiber diets is not consistent; some studies have found that it helps lower the risk, while other studies have not. It is not clear whether diets low in fat are helpful in lowering risk.     Limit alcohol.    Drinking alcohol in moderation or not at all may help lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

If you have a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps or had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a young age (<60 years), your risk may be higher than normal. If your father, mother, brother, or sister had colorectal cancer, your risk may be two to three times higher than that of a person who has no family history of the disease. If you have one or more close relatives diagnosed with colorectal cancer at an older age (>60 years), your risk may be increased, but not as much as if a relative had been diagnosed at a younger age. If you or a close relative have multiple polyps in the colon or rectum or were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at an early age (<50 years), it is especially important that your doctors know about your family medical history and that you have your first screening two years before the earliest age at diagnosis (or at age 25 if it was diagnosed before age 25) in the family member.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - Screening tests can help prevent colorectal cancer.    - Tests that examine the colon and rectum can both find and prevent colorectal cancer by identifying precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) so that they can be removed before they turn into cancer.

Several screening tests can be used for this.\\n                    These include:         -  CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy): a minimally invasive test that uses x-rays and computers to produce images of the entire colon and rectum.     -  Flexible sigmoidoscopy: a procedure to look inside the rectum and lower part of the colon to check for polyps or cancer.     -  Colonoscopy: a procedure to look inside the rectum and entire colon to check for polyps or cancer.     -  Stool DNA test: a test to check DNA in stool (solid waste) samples for certain abnormal sections of DNA that come from polyps or cancer cells. If the test is abnormal, a colonoscopy to diagnose colorectal cancer may be done. If you have no abnormal sections of DNA in your stool, you still can have polyps or colorectal cancer.     -  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): a test to check stool samples for hidden (occult) blood. Blood in the stool may be a sign of polyps or cancer.     -  Fecal immunochemical test (FIT): a test for blood in the stool. The sample is treated with antibodies to see whether there is blood present.\\n                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t        \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                    Different screening tests have different benefits and risks.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                    The screening tests that are used to look for colorectal cancer are slightly different than most cancer screening tests. The other cancer screening tests (such as mammograms, Pap tests, and prostate exams) check the area where the cancer is likely to start. Screening for colorectal cancer checks for cancer and abnormal growths throughout the large intestine. Some tests check the colon only, while others check the rectum only.       The other cancer screening tests (such as mammograms, Pap tests, and prostate exams) check the area where the cancer is likely to start. Screening for colorectal cancer checks for cancer and abnormal growths throughout the large intestine. Some tests check the colon only, while others check the rectum only.      Screening tests have risks. An abnormal test result may cause anxiety until a colonoscopy is done. There is a small chance that the colonoscopy will cause bleeding from where tissue is removed. There is also a very small risk of tearing the large intestine. Although the risk of dying during a colonoscopy is very small, it is higher in older adults. The colonoscopy risks may increase the older you get and if you have serious health problems.     Other risks depend on the test. The FOBT and FIT look for blood in stool samples. Because blood in the stool does not always come from cancer, these tests may suggest that you have cancer when you don't. To be sure, people with a positive (abnormal) FOBT or FIT should have a colonoscopy. However, not everyone who has colorectal cancer or polyps bleeds, so a negative FOBT or FIT is not a guarantee that there is no cancer or polyps.     It is important to understand the benefits and risks of the screening tests you are offered. Although colorectal cancers happen less often in people who have been screened, not all cancers can be found by screening.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                    Talk with your doctor about the best colorectal cancer screening plan for you.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t                    It is important to talk with your doctor about the best colorectal cancer screening plan for you.

The retinal pigment epithelium supports the function and health of the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of the eye (retina) and is important in transporting substances in and out of the retina. Cells of the retinal pigment epithelium take up and break down retinal products, called retinoids, which are generated when the retinal photoreceptor cells convert light into nerve signals. The processing of these retinoids is critical for normal vision. Mutations in the BEST1 gene likely disrupt the normal function of the retinal pigment epithelium, which results in an accumulation of retinoids within it.

Usually a symptom, a sign, or family history leads a person to seek medical care. Some people with the condition seek medical care because a family member, such as a parent, have already been diagnosed with the condition. Doctors typically look for a history of the condition among relatives, since an individual does not need to have signs of the condition present to have it in their family history.  Conditions are diagnosed by a review of a person's signs and symptoms as well as family history. Many conditions are also diagnosed or confirmed through the use of genetic testing. GeneTests features a webpage for medical professionals that discusses the importance of providing genetic counseling before and after genetic testing. To view this information, click here. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. The standardized vocabulary allows for computational analysis of the associations between diseases and other human diseases. The Human Phenotype Ontology also provides definitions and synonyms for the phenotypic abnormalities that are used to describe human disease. Detailed information on how the Human Phenotype Ontology is being used to help patients is available. To diagnose Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, the following signs are typically present:  Electro-oculogram (EOG) abnormality A yellow round \\\"egg-yolk\\\" lesion within the macula in stage II (vitelliform), stage III (pseudohypopyon) and stage IV (vitelliruptive) stages. Reduced central vision often becomes apparent by the middle stage of the condition. With Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, an eye doctor, specifically an ophthalmologist, may also use the following tests to aid in the diagnosis: Fundus autofluorescence Optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing Genetic testing to include the BEST1 gene and may involve additional genes (PRPH2, IMPG1, IMPG2, and C1QTNF5). Once a patient is diagnosed, doctors typically ask about family medical history and/or recommend that family members come in for evaluations to identify additional family members who also have the condition.

Beta-thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. This condition results in a lack of oxygen in the body and can cause mild or severe anemia. There are two types of beta-thalassemia: beta-thalassemia minor and beta-thalassemia major. Beta-thalassemia minor usually causes mild anemia that typically does not result in serious complications requiring treatment. Beta-thalassemia major, also called Cooley's anemia, is the most severe form of beta-thalassemia. Usually characterized by severe anemia, Cooley's anemia typically requires frequent blood transfusions. Cooley's anemia is not usually apparent until after age 6 months. Some of the signs and symptoms are severe weakness, fatigue or tiredness, pale or yellowish skin, facial bone deformities, slow growth, abdominal swelling and dark urine.

BM is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness and contractures affecting the joints of the fingers, wrists, elbows, neck, and knees. BM is classified as a congenital myopathy.  The signs and symptoms of BM usually begin in the first 2 decades of life. Muscle weakness and skin stiffness (induration) are often the earliest features of the disease. Joint stiffness and muscle weakness continue to get worse, causing affected individuals to fall often and trip over their toes. As a result, many people with BM walk on the balls of their feet (toe walking). Other movement-related problems include a swaying gait (ataxia) and an abnormal side-to-side (laterally restricted) motion of the shoulders.  While BM begins in childhood in most cases, affected people may have few signs and symptoms later in adulthood and have a normal life expectancy. The muscle weakness associated with BM generally does not affect head, facial, or other muscles used for moving (skeletal muscles), although some affected individuals may experience weakness in these muscles. The other muscles of the body, such as those used for breathing (respiratory muscles), are rarely affected. Some older adults with BM develop stiff joints in their backs (spines), which can contribute to curvature of the spine (kyphosis).  Rarely, affected people develop recurrent stretches of strong muscle contractions in the forearm (\\\"forearm myositis\\\"), followed by painful muscle wasting and weakness (atrophy). In addition, some individuals have tight or thickened skin of the hands or abdomen. Occasionally, affected individuals have thin skin with veins that are very visible through the skin of the upper arms and legs, as well as herniation of muscles between the ribs. All of these signs and symptoms are considered typical of BM.  Other rare features have been reported in a few individuals with BM. Swelling (edema) of the limbs may be seen in infancy due to blockages (obstructions) in the blood vessels. Additional symptoms that have affected a small number of people with BM include curved toes (hitchhiker's toe sign), soft nails, loose joints, shortening of connective tissues throughout the body (generalized fibrosis), kidney failure, and small pupils that fail to constrict (respond) in bright light.

Bethlem myopathy is caused by mutations in either the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 genes. These genes provide instructions for making three protein chains (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) that combine to form a larger protein called type VI collagen.  Type VI collagen is an important part of the extracellular matrix, which provides support and stimuli crucial for controlling cell behavior and the development and repair of tissues. Type VI collagen forms a network of molecules that connect with other types of proteins in the extracellular matrix, including other collagens, helping to maintain the structural integrity of tissues. Type VI collagen also attaches (binds) muscle cells to the surrounding extracellular matrix. The binding of muscle cells to the extracellular matrix allows developed force within the cells to be transmitted across the muscle. The result is the contraction of individual muscle fibers and the entire muscle.  Type VI collagen is found throughout the body, but it plays an especially important role in skeletal muscles, which are used for movement. Mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 reduce the amount of type VI collagen that is produced or interfere with the ability of the individual alpha chains to assemble properly into type VI collagen trimers. Mutations also can disrupt the ability of the trimers to assemble correctly into the larger type VI collagen molecule or the collagen molecules to attach to each other to form the network that provides strength to the extracellular matrix. As a result, the skeletal muscles of affected people are more vulnerable to injury. Over time, repeated muscle damage results in muscle weakness and wasting, which are characteristic features of Bethlem myopathy. Researchers are not certain why some people with a mutation in one of the COL6 genes develop Bethlem myopathy and others develop Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. It is possible that the variation in signs and symptoms is influenced by the type or location of the COL6 gene mutation.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"What causes Bethlem myopathy?

Mutations in any of the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes result in abnormal type VI collagen that cannot be assembled correctly or that makes an unstable network of fibers. The lack or malfunction of type VI collagen damages muscle cells and impairs muscle strength and movement. Researchers believe mutations in these genes account for about half of the cases of Bethlem myopathy.

Bethlem myopathy is caused by mutations in either the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 gene.

Collagen VI is normally found in a network of connective tissue that surrounds muscle cells and nerves, and helps to strengthen and protect them. The absence or reduction of collagen VI in these areas weakens the muscle and results in contractures.  The genetic cause of Bethlem myopathy is ultimately responsible for its neurologic manifestations.

Mutations in the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes affect the structure of type VI collagen, preventing it from assembling correctly.

Bethlem myopathy is caused by genetic changes (mutations) in the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 gene. All forms of this condition were previously thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, autosomal recessive inheritance also can occur. In autosomal dominant inheritance, the target gene has a mutation in one its two copies. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. The protein produced from the gene is called the type VI (6) collagen \u03b1 1-chain, \u03b12-chain, or \u03b13-chain. Collagen is a protein used to strengthen and add structure to many parts of the body, including muscles. The type VI collagen \u03b1 1-chain, \u03b12-chain, or \u03b13-chain is made up of several smaller molecules that twist around each other to form one large molecule. Several large molecules cluster together to form one type VI collage (or collagen alpha 1, 2 or 3) molecule. Clusters of type VI collagen molecules form fibers, called microfibrils, which attach to many other molecules to form connective tissue. The genetic changes that cause Bethlem myopathy can impair microfibril or connective tissue formation. As a result, muscles are weak, making movement difficult, and they are prone to injury.

The signs and symptoms of bilateral polymicrogyria generally begin in childhood. Affected children may have mild to moderate intellectual disability. They may experience developmental delay, in which milestones such as sitting, walking, and talking are delayed. Developmental delay can also affect areas related to social and emotional interaction (social delay, autistic tendencies) and communication (speech delay).  Many children with bilateral polymicrogyria have seizures (epilepsy). The epilepsy can be severe and resistant to treatment; in these cases, the condition is called bilateral frontal polymicrogyria and perisylvian polymicrogyria with epilepsy. Some children with this form of the disorder also have acquired microcephaly; this term means their head size was typical at birth but their brain growth slowed in early childhood and the head size did not increase as would be expected.  Bilateral polymicrogyria can occur due to damage to the brain during development. It can also be associated with certain genetic disorders, such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, bilateral frontonasal malformation with bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, and X-linked tubulin alpha-1 chain (TUBA1A)-related disorder.

Oromotor dysfunction contributes to feeding problems, speech delays, and choking episodes. Some affected individuals also have a high-arched or cleft palate.  BFPMG leads to abnormal patterns of muscle development and control (muscle tone abnormalities known as dystonia or athetosis) and uncontrollable movements (congenital athetotic tetraparesis) that primarily affect the four limbs (tetraparesis). As a result, some children with BFPMG are unable to control their hands or walk, while others are able to use their hands and walk but with difficulty. Individuals with BFPMG may also have seizures that begin in infancy.  The signs and symptoms of BFPMG become less severe with age. Muscle stiffness and uncontrolled movements lessen, or these problems may disappear entirely. Oromotor dysfunction diminishes and feeding problems resolve. However, most people with BFPMG continue to have difficulty controlling certain facial and mouth movements, which leads to speech difficulties. While seizures typically continue into adulthood, the affected individuals' seizures generally become less severe.  BFPMG is caused by mutations in the WDR62 gene.

Affected individuals typically have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and markedly delayed growth of motor skills in infancy. Subsequently, most have mild to severe intellectual disability and poorly developed speech. Some affected individuals also have epilepsy. Behavioral issues such as irritability and inability to focus are also common. Language and social skills tend to be less impaired than motor skills, meaning that BFPP does not result in frank autism.   The specific constellation of brain abnormalities seen in BFPP leads to the neurological impairments characteristic of the condition. A key brain abnormality is a defect in how the folds of the brain, known as gyrus (gyri), develop - an abnormality known as polymicrogyria. The polymicrogyria is most prominent in the front (frontal lobe) and side (parietal lobe) regions of the cerebrum, which is the part of the brain responsible for conscious thought, speech, sensory processing, and voluntary movement.  A variety of additional cerebral malformations can result, such as hydrocephalus (an abnormal buildup of fluid in the brain that can increase pressure, expand the skull, and damage brain tissue), areas of low brain tissue volume (hypoplasia) and a crystalline deposit in the middle of the brain (iron deposition in the basal ganglia). Polymicrogyria in BFPP is also associated with misplacement or abnormal development of nerve cells in the white matter, which is the tissue through which nerve impulses are transmitted. Myelin, a fatty material that insulates nerve cells and helps nerve signals travel efficiently, is also abnormally deposited in BFPP. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these characteristic brain abnormalities in people affected with BFPP.   BFPP is caused by a change (mutation) in the gene GPR56.

GPR56, also called ADGRG1, is responsible for recessive cases, while FCMD is responsible for dominant cases. GPR56 or ADGRG1 mutations can cause different severities of brain malformation with associated problems with muscle tone and brain and spine formation, in addition to bfp polymicrogyria. The software that analyzes DNA which identifies the mutations in GPR56, called SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster, shows severe changes to the gene which are likely to disable it.

In this disorder, these brain abnormalities typically involve the frontal lobes (brain regions located just behind the forehead) and parietal lobes (brain regions near the middle of the brain towards the top and back of the head). Genetic mutations can cause bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria to be an inherited condition.  People with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria typically have muscle weakness in the arms and legs and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), though the severity of these features can vary widely. Decreased muscle tone in combination with the weakness of the limbs usually results in delayed motor development in infancy (e.g., slowing in the age at which a child with this disorder will sit independently or walk). Additional features can include cognitive impairment or intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe; seizures, especially absent seizures; difficulty speaking due to impaired movements in the muscles used in speech (dysarthria); small head size (microcephaly); and joint abnormalities such as unusual joint angles (contractures) and/or swelling of joints due to fluid buildup (edema). Many people also have vision problems, such as partial or complete blindness, involuntary rapid eye movements (nystagmus), and small or unusually shaped eyes (coloboma).  Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria can result from genetic mutations in several genes. A half to two-thirds of affected people have no known history of the condition in their families and are thought to have a new (de novo) genetic mutation that occurred spontaneously around the time of conception. In these cases, the condition typically results from mutations in the PIK3R2 or PIK3CA genes.

The condition nearly always affects folds and grooves on the outer surface of a particular part of the brain, which is known as the perisylvian region. This region of the brain carries information for movement and sensations in the face and mouth, so impairments can lead to dysarthria and pseudobulbar paresis. In some cases, the condition extends more broadly in the brain, with polymicrogyria affecting other regions and causing intellectual disability, epilepsy, or other issues.  Children with BPP typically have mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and delayed development of motor skills. Those with BPP often experience seizures, which appear to be correlated with the amount of polymicrogyria in the brain. Mobility problems range from mild to severe, but people with more extensive polymicrogyria in the brain usually have more severe problems and can require a wheelchair.

These exposures include a combination of certain medications (such as benzodiazepines, antiepileptic medications, acetazolamide) and infections, including the TORCH infections which affect the fetus.  Genetic causes of BPP may be either isolated to the brain or occur as part of a larger syndrome involving other organs. Specifically,  BPP has been found to be isolated to the brain and caused by a genetic alteration (pathogenic variant) in a gene called PIK3R2. This genetic alteration can be inherited from a parent or occur spontaneously before birth.  It has also been reported as part of a syndrome involving the brain and kidneys caused by a pathogenic variant in the gene CC2D2A.  Additionally, BPP can occur with agenesis of the corpus callosum (when the two halves of the brain are underdeveloped or absent) as part of a syndrome known as MPPH syndrome.

How is bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria diagnosed? The diagnosis of bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP) is typically based on the signs and symptoms that are established in a comprehensive clinical evaluation, which usually includes a neurologic examination and developmental assessment. Physicians may suspect BPP in individuals with signs and symptoms such as oropharyngeal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and epilepsy.

Damage to the white matter can lead to loss of memory, difficulties thinking or understanding, loss of bladder control and difficulty with walking, problems speaking, and personality changes. The symptoms and severity of Binswanger's disease are quite variable from person to person. Damage to nerves that regulate bladder function can cause urinary incontinence. The loss of nerve cells involved in regulating muscle control in the legs can cause a loss of balance and difficulty walking. Similarly, decline in other cognitive abilities such as judgment and attention can interfere with other movements such as orienting one's body in space. Damage to nerves can also affect the ability to speak clearly, resulting in slower speech with a stutter. People with Binswanger's disease may become apathetic or show obsessive-compulsive behavior.

When this occurs it can lead to acid build-up in the blood (acidosis) and problems with the nervous system including brain swelling (encephalopathy), muscle weakness, low muscle tone, problems moving, seizures, rash around the mouth and anus, hair loss and developmental delay.

In its free form, biotin is absorbed from foods and supplements. When biotin is bound to proteins, it is released and recycled by an enzyme called biotinidase. In individuals with biotinidase deficiency, the enzyme is absent or reduced, which interferes with the body's ability to reuse and recycle biotin from food. Individuals with the disorder have a biotin deficiency that affects the function of four other enzymes: (1) acetyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which help break down fats and help regulate glucose (blood sugar) production from noncarbohydrate sources,(2) beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, which helps break down the amino acid leucine, and (3) pyruvate carboxylase, which is used in gluconeogenesis, the metabolic pathway that produces glucose.  In untreated infants with profound biotinidase deficiency, the first signs of the disorder typically appear between two and four months of age and include seizures and loss of appetite. Affected infants may also be unable to coordinate movements, have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), develop a red scaly rash around body openings (perioral and perianal dermatitis), show delays in reaching developmental milestones, as well as delays in speech and motor skills, and experience vision and hearing loss. Many infants also experience hyperventilation, which may be triggered by overexcitement, pain, or heat.  Delayed treatment of affected infants can result in conditions such as ataxia, coma, breathing problems, tremors, nystagmus (a condition that causes involuntary eye movement), poor growth, hair loss, and optic atrophy, which can lead to blindness.  In some individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency, signs and symptoms, such as seizures and developmental delay, appear in childhood or adolescence. Mild learning delays and mild social difficulties have also been observed in some affected children.

The disease mainly affects whites of Northern European descent, with few, if any, cases in African Americans reported. Birdshot chorioretinopathy tends to affect people in middle age but has been diagnosed in childhood in rare cases. Females and males appear to be affected equally.    Early symptoms of birdshot chorioretinopathy may include: mild blurring, flashing lights, floaters, variable dull eye pain, and/or redness. Some cases may begin with conjunctivitis. The most commonly reported symptoms include decreased night vision and floaters. Fluorescein angiography may reveal leakage and delayed filling of the retinal blood vessels. A \\\"sunset glow\\\" appearance, or depigmentation of the retina, may be noted. Over time, vision may become moderately to severely impaired. In rare cases a loss of peripheral vision or color vision may be noted. If untreated, patients typically experience severe loss of central acuity (i.e., clarity/sharpness of vision) by 5-10 years.    Clinical examination reveals scattered patches of depigmentation or hypopigmented \\\"birdshot\\\" lesions in the midperiphery or periphery of the retina. The birdshot lesions are variably sized and shaped and tend not to involve the macula or optic disc. Over time, the patches become more prominent and well delineated. Macular edema and optic nerve swelling may be observed. Inflammation may affect the iris, ciliary body, vitreous humor, and peripheral retina.    The cause of birdshot chorioretinopathy remains unknown. There appears to be an association with a certain genetic marker (i.e., human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A29). Birdshot chorioretinopathy is not contagious, is not known to be genetic, and all forms of treatment are off-label. Long term immunosuppressive therapy is usually necessary and involves drugs with notable risks of serious side effects.

Common complaints include floaters and difficulty with vision, including difficulty driving at night, blurred vision, sensitivity to light and/or reduced peripheral vision. Duration and severity can vary and many symptoms tend to fluctuate. Birdshot is usually bilateral (affects both eyes), however signs and symptoms can vary from one eye to the other. Inflammation of the retina and choroid can cause some permanent changes in the circulation of the eyes, which may impair the function of the affected cells. This may lead to symptoms such as loss of contrast sensitivity and color vision, a reduction in peripheral and night vision, and light sensitivity (due to loss of photoreceptors in the retina). A person with Birdshot may develop cystoid macular edema, a condition in which multiple cysts form leading to loss of central vision. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is usually very slow to progress and blindness is rare. However, the human eye can typically compensate for and tolerate loss of function of one half of the retina.

To diagnose bladder cancer, samples of cells and tissue from the bladder are checked for cancer cells.

Urine is made in your kidneys and travels to your bladder through two thin tubes, called ureters.

Cancer starts in the innermost lining of the bladder. Then it grows into the middle muscle layer of the bladder wall. Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas. This means that they begin in the cells that line the inside of the bladder. Some bladder cancers begin in other cells in the bladder.     If you have bladder cancer, you may see blood in your urine or have pain when urinating. Tests that examine the urine and imaging tests can help doctors diagnose bladder cancer.

Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes this orderly process goes wrong. New cells form when the body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may spread into (invade) nearby tissue. In addition to invading nearby tissue, cancer cells can break away from a tumor and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system. As they travel through the bloodstream or lymph system, they can settle in other parts of the body. This is called metastasis.     Bladder cancer forms in the tissues of the bladder and is named according to the tissue where the cancer forms. The most common type of bladder cancer, called transitional cell carcinoma, starts in cells called urothelial cells lining up inside the bladder. Transitions cells can also be found in the ureters and top part of the urethra (see below).    The bladder is a hollow organ in the lower part of the abdomen. It is about the size and shape of a pear. The bladder has an expandable wall made of layers of connective tissue and muscle lined by a thin, moist layer of tissue made of a special type of epithelial cells called transitional cells. The bladder stores urine, which is made by the kidneys and carried to the bladder by two thin tubes called ureters. When urine is formed, extra fluid and waste material are removed from the blood by the kidneys and become urine. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters and into the bladder. When the bladder becomes full, urine is passed through another tube called the urethra out of the body.     Although various factors increase the risk of getting bladder cancer, there is no sure way to prevent it.    Bladder cancer may cause no signs or symptoms in its early stages.    \\n    \\n    \\n    Key Points\\n    - Bladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the bladder.    - The most common type of bladder cancer starts in cells called urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder.    - Bladder cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages.    - Having blood in the urine is a common sign of bladder cancer.    - Tests that examine the urine and bladder are used to detect (find) and diagnose bladder cancer.    - Some factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).    - Cancer treatment can cause side effects.    - Five types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery      - Intravesical therapy      - Chemotherapy      - Radiation therapy      - Immunotherapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.

Other eyelid problems can occur as a result, including crossed eyes (strabismus), eyes that do not point in the same direction (ocular misalignment), and eyes that don't open fully. Vision is usually normal in affected people, but may be impaired if eyelid problems are left untreated.  People with BPES are classified as having one of two types of the condition. In type 1 BPES, affected people have eyelid problems and, in females, reduced ovarian function (also known as premature ovarian failure).

The eyelid abnormalities that occur in BPES include blepharophimosis (underdeveloped eyelids), ptosis (low-set eyelids), epicanthus inversus (a fold of skin that runs from the bottom of the nose to the upper eyelid), and telecanthus (wide spacing between the upper eyelids). The eyelid abnormalities are apparent early in life, and most affected people require eye surgery to correct these problems and improve vision. These distinctive facial abnormalities give people with BPES a characteristic appearance; however, the disorder typically does not affect eye function.  Less commonly, BPES has been associated with other abnormalities, including signs and symptoms of premature aging; skeletal, nasal, palatal, hand and foot, genitourinary, and heart defects; and variable intellectual disability.

Researchers have described two types of BPES: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 causes eyelid abnormalities and a group of symptoms known as ovarian follicle dysfunction that affects female sex organs. Ovarian follicle dysfunction often causes a condition called premature ovarian failure (POF), which can lead to infertility. In contrast, type 2 affects only the eyelids and does not affect fertility. Rarely, both reproductive problems and infertility are seen in individuals with type 2.  These eye and reproductive features occur because of changes (mutations) in different areas of the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene. This gene provides instructions for making a type of protein called a transcription factor. Transcription factors bind to DNA and turn genes on or off. The FOXL2 transcription factor plays a role in the development of the eyelids before birth and in the development of sex organs, especially the ovaries.

Researchers believe that it may develop as a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In some cases, blepharospasm may occur in conjunction with other neurological conditions.  The main feature of blepharospasm is involuntary blinking or spasming of the eyelids. Mild symptoms include the need to rub the eyes, close the eyes, blink, or yawn. Eye or forehead pain, eye irritation, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and dry eyes are sometimes reported. Other features can include involuntary grimacing or tics. Symptoms may continue for weeks or months before the onset of the actual spasms.  Symptoms tend to progress over time. Isolated blepharospasm may be relieved, at least temporarily, by touching under the nose, below the lower eyelid, or on the back of the head. This is called a sensory trick or 'geste antagoniste'.  There is not a cure for blepharospasm but treatments are available to help reduce the spasms. These treatments include eye lubricants, tinted glasses to reduce glare, stress management, and regular sleep. In some cases, people may consider eyelid surgery in order to reduce the symptoms.

Often individuals are able to voluntarily open their eyelids during the spasms, although it may require concentrated effort. The spasms may be misdiagnosed as seizures.  In some cases, eyelid spasms interfere with performing activities that require concentration and vision, such as reading, and even driving. Blepharospasm is different from \\\"dry eyes\\\".

People with this condition mistakenly see reds, greens, and (yellow,) as similar colors, when they should be distinct. They also have trouble distinguishing any colors in dim light. Nearly all males with blue cone monochromatism have the sharpness of vision needed to read 20/80 or worse without glasses. Other eye abnormalities are also characteristic of blue cone monochromatism, including involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) and extreme nearsightedness (high myopia).  Color vision depends on cells in the eye called cones, which detect light and color. Humans usually have three types of cones, which detect red (long, or L, wavelengths of light), green (medium, or M, wavelengths), and blue (short, or S, wavelengths). The combination of these three types of cones gives people normal color vision (trichromacy).  People with blue cone monochromatism lack L cones and M cones. They only have S cones, the blue cones. Because they only have one type of cone, these individuals are called monochromats. Blue cone monochromatism and achromatopsia (which is caused by a lack of all three types of cones) are the two types of cone monochromatism. Cone monochromacy is often associated with a condition called rod monochromacy. Rods are another type of cell in the eye; light detection by rods results in vision (sight) without color (black and white).

Some people have no other symptoms and no apparent health problems. The age at which the bobble-head movements begin varies from around age 1 to 12 years, but most often occurs between ages 3 and 6. When a brain cyst is the underlying cause, the abnormal head movements almost always appear once the cyst has enlarged.

Intellectual disability associated with BFLS may range from mild to severe. Behavioral abnormalities may occur, as well, including autism spectrum behaviors and obsession with food. In early childhood, individuals with this syndrome may be overweight; however, they develop an appearance characterized by thin arms and legs and excess fat deposits on the upper body and upper back (buffalo hump) in adolescence or early adulthood. Facial features characteristic of BFLS include drooping eyelids (ptosis), deep-set eyes, narrow eyelid openings (palpebral fissures), a long face, a prominent nose, a square jaw, and large ears that stick out from the head.  Males with BFLS have distinctive bumps (nodules) on their testes that are related to the same genetic mutation that causes the other signs and symptoms of this condition. Most males with BFLS have small testes and abnormally low levels of testosterone. Low levels of testosterone in affected males are associated with impaired development of the genitalia, changes (mosaicism) in some cells affecting the number or structure of the X chromosomes, and intellectual disability.  Additional features of BFLS include low muscle tone (hypotonia); weak muscle strength; floppiness of joints; restricted movement of some joints; flexion contractures of the hand; and other joint problems. Some individuals with BFLS experience recurrent seizures as well as abnormalities in brain development. Some affected individuals may have an extra skin fold across the palm. In some individuals, the fingers are fused together and the thumbs are in an unusual position and may be fixed with the palm towards the back of the hand (pronated thumb). Dental problems are common and may include an extra number of small teeth (supernumerary natal teeth), umbrella-shaped molars, small lower jaw, widely spaced teeth, missing teeth, and teeth that protrude slightly from the mouth.

All affected individuals have a short and broad thumb. Carpal bones LABC (lunate, triquetral, and pisiform) and LM (lunar and magnum) are absent. The most striking and consistent feature of this type of brachydactyly is the presence of aplasia or hypoplasia of the lateral (ulnar), and frequently also of the medial (radial), phalanges in the second through fifth fingers. This is associated with nail aplasia/hypoplasia on the respective fingers. Some textbooks include aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx of the thumb as a characteristic feature as well.

Platelets are blood cells that help the blood to clot.    In most cases, having too many platelets does not cause problems. However, eating aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause the platelets to not work properly, which may lead to bleeding problems. Fewer than 1 in 5 people with ET have signs or symptoms of the disease. These may include the following: Overgrowth of blood vessels under the skin, which look like red dots or lines. A feeling of burning or painful tingling in the hands or feet. A headache. Vision problems. Dizziness. Weakness.

Normally, the number of platelets made in the bone marrow is determined by the body?s need to replace platelets that are lost by bleeding or in tissues where there is injury or a healing wound. In ET, however, high numbers of platelets are made even when they are not needed. Very high numbers of platelets in the blood may cause excessive bleeding or the formation of blood clots. A high number of platelets can also lead to increased numbers of white blood cells and red blood cells.     ET is one of several types of myeloproliferative neoplasms. In patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), part of the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of MPNs:         -  Polycythemia Vera and Other Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment     -  Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment: Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Polycythemia Vera, Essential Thrombocythemia, and Myelofibrosis\\n                \\n                \\n                    Most patients with essential thrombocythemia have no symptoms.\\n                   Most patients with ET do not have symptoms. Rarely, patients with ET have a headache or pain, tingling, or numbness in the hands or feet. These symptoms result from too many platelets in the blood. Very high numbers of platelets may also cause excessive bleeding or the formation of blood clots. Some patients with ET have both bleeding and clotting problems.\\n                \\n                \\n                    A blood sample is checked to diagnose essential thrombocythemia.\\n                    A diagnosis of ET is made only when the platelet count is very high. If less than 1 million platelets per microliter of blood are found, ET is not diagnosed. In addition, other causes of high numbers of platelets, such as an infection, a chronic inflammatory disease, a type of cancer that spreads to the bone marrow, iron-deficiency anemia, or other bone marrow diseases, must be ruled out. Because signs and symptoms of some other diseases and infections are the same as those of ET, careful diagnosis is important. The following tests may be used to screen for ET:          -   Complete blood count with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted. The blood sample may also be checked for other factors, such as the percentage of blood made up of red blood cells (hematocrit), the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells, and the size and shape of the red blood cells. A differential white blood cell count is also done to count and see the different types of white blood cells. The complete blood count is usually done in the doctor?s office.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as electrolytes (the salts and minerals, such as sodium and potassium, in your blood that affect how your body functions), creatinine (the chemical waste product that is removed by the kidneys) and urea nitrogen (the end product of protein metabolism, which is removed by the kidneys), and liver enzymes (proteins that speed chemical reactions in the body) in the blood. The way these substances are found in the blood may give the doctor clues about how well certain organs, such as the liver and kidneys, are working.    -  Blood clotting studies : Procedures to measure the time it takes for blood to clot and the amount of clotting factors the blood has.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Treatment for essential thrombocythemia may include\\n                    Treatment of ET is based on whether patients have certain risk factors, such as very high platelet counts (more than 1.5 million per microliter of blood), very old or very young age, bleeding\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - Essential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets (cells that help blood clot) are made in the bone marrow.    - Signs and symptoms of essential thrombocythemia include dizziness and chest pain.    - A blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) can help diagnose essential thrombocythemia.     - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Essential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets (cells that help blood clot) are made in the bone marrow.\\n                    Platelets are one of the many types of blood cells made in the red bone marrow (the soft, spongy tissue in the center of the bones).

Drug therapy     Drug therapy may be used to stop the formation of extra platelets , lower the blood platelet count, or prevent or stop blood clots.     As platelet counts come down and the number of normally functioning platelets increases, most patients have fewer signs and symptoms of essential thrombocythemia. Once blood counts are stable, patients should continue to have regular checkups every 3 to 6 months. The type of drugs used to treat essential thrombocythemia may include the following:            - Anagrelide may be used to decrease the formation of new platelets in the bone marrow.    - Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) may be used to suppress the body\ufffds production of platelets and decrease the chance of blood clots.    - Interferon alfa may be used in pregnant patients or in patients who cannot take hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. An increased risk of side effects may limit its use.     - Acetylsalicylic acid (low-dose aspirin), an anti-inflammatory drug, may be used to treat patients with headaches, tiredness, dizziness, chest pain, or numbness to decrease the chance of having a heart attack or stroke. This drug should be used very carefully due to the increased risk of bleeding in patients with essential thrombocythemia.     - Prednisone is a drug that acts against inflammation in the body. It may be used to treat patients whose essential thrombocythemia is caused by another disease that causes inflammation, like rheumatoid arthritis.     - New drugs for patients with essential thrombocythemia are being tested in clinical trials. Some of these drugs include MAP-kinase, Akt, and mTOR inhibitors as well as Janus kinase (JAK) 2 inhibitors.              Plateletpheresis      Plateletpheresis is a procedure that takes platelets out of the blood and removes them from the bloodstream. During plateletpheresis, a doctor passes the patients blood through an apheresis machine that takes the platelets out of the blood. Then the red blood cells and the rest of the blood are returned to the patient. This procedure may be used in some cases if there are too many platelets in the blood, but is not used as a first line of treatment for essential thrombocythemia.       Splenectomy     Splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen. A spleen that is larger than normal can be made smaller or removed by cutting the blood supply to the spleen or by surgically removing it. This procedure may be used to relieve signs or symptoms caused by an enlarged spleen, treat anemia caused by the spleen, make it easier to give chemotherapy, or treat other complications of essential thrombocythemia. When the spleen is removed, the liver takes over its functions.       Irradiation     External-beam irradiation is a type of radiation therapy that uses a machine to aim high-energy rays (such as x-rays) from outside the body into the tumor. This procedure may be used to treat an enlarged spleen as a result of essential thrombocythemia. External-beam irradiation to the spleen may make it smaller and improve signs and symptoms. External-beam irradiation cures neither the enlarged spleen nor the essential thrombocythemia, so further treatment with radiation therapy may be needed.       Biologic therapy      Biologic therapy is treatment that uses substances made from living organisms to treat cancer. It may also be called biotherapy or immunotherapy. For example, interferon alfa is a biologic agent that may be used\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Treatment of essential thrombocythemia may include aspirin and/or plateletpheresis; high-risk patients may also receive cytoreductive therapy.

For example, people with essential tremor may spill food when they try to eat, talk, or dress and may have difficulty writing or using hand tools. If the tremor involves the voice, people with essential tremor may frequently have voice breaks or a quavering or hoarse voice. Essential tremor can be disabling and is especially troublesome for people whose work requires fine motor skills or a steady voice. Although not considered life-threatening, it is associated with increased rates of depression and are less likely to exercise and socialize.  Essential tremor usually begins in the teenage years to mid-60s. It is typically a slowly progressive disorder, with tremor signs becoming gradually more noticeable over time. It may stay mild, become severe, or level off. The condition usually affects both sides of the body in the beginning stages, although sometimes it can begin on one side.

In some families with essential tremor, they have looked for the genetic cause of the disease by studying family members who have the condition. Using this approach, researchers have linked the disorder to places on several chromosomes, including the region of chromosome 6q known as FET1 and the region of chromosome 3q known as ETM. Because these regions are relatively large, genes associated with the disease have not been identified.  In a separate group of people with essential tremor, researchers used a different approach, scanning the genome for differences between people with tremors and healthy people without tremors. This comparison led to the suggestion that a variation in the LINGO1 gene was associated with an increased risk of developing essential tremor. The LINGO1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found on the surface of nervous system cells. This protein and an associated group of proteins appear to regulate the growth and development of nerve cell extensions that allow neurons to communicate with each other and the formation and survival of new neurons in the brain. The LINGO1 protein may also regulate the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, an insulating material that forms around nerve cell extensions and is essential for the proper transmission of nerve impulses.

Problems with the blood vessels also affect the skin, particularly on the buttocks and backs of the knees, where small purple areas (petechiae) and bruises appear. Low muscle tone and weakness in the legs make walking difficult, which can lead to an abnormal, waddling gait. Other uncommon signs and symptoms that occur in this disorder include structural abnormalities of the hindbrain called the cerebellum and brainstem, a small head size (microcephaly), stiff joints or fixed joints in an abnormal position (joint contractures), optic atrophy, and retinopathy.

Many of these reactions occur within the mitochondria.  The ETHE1 protein appears to have a role in the break down of hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of bacteria living in the intestine. If hydrogen sulfide is not broken down appropriately, levels of the substance become high, resulting in toxic effects. In particular, hydrogen sulfide is toxic to blood vessels; it can damage blood vessels, reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery to various parts of the brain and to the muscles, fat, and skin of the extremities. Overproduction of hydrogen sulfide can react with enzymes involved in energy production, resulting in an accumulation of various breakdown products of energy metabolism, such as ethylmalonic acid.  ETHE1 gene mutations change single protein pieces within the ETHE1 protein or directly disrupt the protein's ability to carry out its function.

Stitches used to close the skin after surgery are sometimes left in place for a long time because it takes a long time for this tissue to heal. When the tumor is taken out through surgery, the healthy tissue around the tumor is also removed. This is called a margin. Having cancer cells at the outside edge of the tissue that is removed during surgery is called a positive margin. A positive margin means that some tumor cells may be left in the body. A negative margin means there are no tumor cells at the outer edge of the tissue. If the margin is positive, more surgery may be needed.       Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Because a soft tissue or bone tumor may affect the way the body looks or works, patients may have special surgery to improve the way they look or work. This is called reconstructive or rehabilitation surgery, and may be done at the same time as the tumor-removal surgery.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy can include the following special treatment:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT): A type of external radiation therapy, SBRT uses special equipment to position the patient and to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor. SBRT is used to treat tumors that are not able to be removed by surgery. It is also used to treat small tumors in organs such as the lung, kidney, and liver.           -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat Ewing sarcoma.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy is the main treatment for metastatic Ewing sarcoma.    For Ewing sarcoma, chemotherapy is almost always given in combination with other types of treatment, such as surgery and/or radiation therapy. This can include:            -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Chemotherapy given before surgery to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove.           -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Chemotherapy given after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.

Special doctors who have experience in treating adolescents and young adults and rare cancers should be consulted. Treatment will be overseen by a radiation oncologist and/or a medical oncologist. A radiation oncologist is a doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer. A medical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medicines such as chemotherapy. Because treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may change the function of the heart, lungs, bones, or other parts of the body in the years after treatment, pediatric oncologists (cancer doctors who specialize in treating children) or medical oncologists with experience in long-term follow-up may also be included in the treatment team.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist.\\n                    A medical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer patients with chemotherapy.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Treatment of Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.\\n                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.

Usually, patients treated with surgery also receive chemotherapy. For some patients, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are given before surgery to shrink the tumor. This is called neoadjuvant therapy. A complete response to neoadjuvant therapy may indicate the cancer has been completely destroyed or may be associated with better survival.   Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with newly diagnosed Ewing Sarcoma and Cancer, Ewing Sarcoma, of Bone. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug.

It may include a certain number of cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery or radiation therapy. The protocol may also include high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. Treatment may also include targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and GD2 receptor antibody therapy to attack cancer cells.

Years after treatment, there may be an increased risk of second cancers.     Late effects may be treated or controlled.

When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. Almost all patients with Ewing sarcoma have combination chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be given before and/or after surgery, radiation therapy, or both.    Even when symptoms have disappeared, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery or radiation therapy, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. See Drugs Approved for Ewing Sarcoma for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           Radiation therapy is given to the tumor site and may be given to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body. External radiation therapy to the whole lung may be used to treat lung metastases (cancer that has spread to the lungs from bone or soft tissue).    Heavy-particle therapy, such as proton-beam therapy, is a type of external therapy that uses protons rather than x-rays to treat cancer. See the General Information section of this summary. The way the protons pass through tissue is different from x-rays. The radiation dose is deposited over a narrow range of distance, and there is no exit dose. This means that, compared to x-ray treatment, the radiation dose to the tissues beyond (deeper than) the tumor is zero. Babies and children may be treated with proton-beam therapy to lessen the chance of growth problems and other side effects.       Surgery     Ewing sarcoma tumors are often large, and surgery to remove the tumor can be disfiguring. In a surgical reconstruction, a part of the body is rebuilt using an implant or tissue taken from another part of the patient's body. For example, if a tumor in the arm is removed the part of the arm may be rebuilt with tissue from the leg. If a tumor is in the back or chest wall, the remaining muscles, ribs, or skin may need to be rebuilt using tissue from another part of the body.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key Points\\n                    - There are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.    - Children with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.    - Children may have surgery, radiation therapy, or both to treat Ewing sarcoma.    - Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for Ewing sarcoma.     - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.          - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant for recurrent Ewing sarcoma    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\\n                \\n                \\n                    There are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.\\n                    Different types of treatment are available for children with Ewing sarcoma.

A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Before treatment begins, it is important to talk with your child's doctor about the way treatment may affect your child both in the short term and the long term. Treatment will depend on the following:         - Whether the tumor is in the bone or in the soft tissue.    - The size and location of the tumor.    - Whether the tumor has spread within the bone or soft tissue or to other places in the body.    - Previous treatment.    - How well treatment is working to destroy the cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Children with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\\n                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.

These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric radiologist.    -  Medical geneticist or genetic counselor.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    - Bone marrow transplant specialist.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Children may have surgery, radiation therapy, or both to treat Ewing sarcoma.\\n                    Surgery is the removal of the cancer and a margin of healthy tissue around it. If there is cancer in nearby lymph nodes, the lymph nodes will also be removed.    Because Ewing sarcoma is usually deep within a bone, the doctor will do the following before the surgery is scheduled:         - Take imaging tests of the affected area.    - Check the layer of fat, muscle, and normal tissue around the tumor.        The imaging tests will show the doctor how much of the bone around the tumor must be taken out. The surgery will be planned to spare as much normal tissue as possible. Surgery to remove a tumor that is deep within a bone may require reconstructive surgery.     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:         -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain Ewing sarcomas have small amounts of radioactive material placed inside the body close to the tumor. This is called brachytherapy.    -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.    - The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme functions in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle molecules.

A shortage of this enzyme activity allows Gb3 to build up and can be harmful, particularly to the cells in the heart and blood vessels.  The GLA gene mutations that cause Fabry disease lead to an absent or malfunctioning enzyme, resulting in a build-up of Gb3. It is not clear how or why a shortage of alpha-galactosidase A leads to the skin, eye, acroparesthesia, gastrointestinal, and hypohidrosis signs and symptoms of Fabry disease. Researchers believe that the lack of enzyme activity affects the autonomic nervous system, which regulates the functions of many internal organs, including the heart and circulation. The autonomic nervous system may be involved in all of the early features of Fabry disease. Later in the disease, Gb3 accumulation in the nervous system, mainly in the cells that insulate nerve fibers, may further damage the nerves. This damage can result in losses of sensation, including the ability to feel pain and temperature.  Gb3 buildup also causes changes in the arterial lining and leads to scarring and thickening of the heart and kidney tissues. As a result, many people with Fabry disease die from kidney failure, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, or stroke.  Certain GLA gene mutations are associated with more severe Fabry disease (classic Fabry disease), and others are associated with less severe disease (later-onset Fabry disease, see Classification). The more severe form of this condition is associated with little or no alpha-galactosidase A activity. The later-onset form occurs in individuals who have some residual enzyme activity.

The facial weakness is often evident when affected individuals attempt to smile or whistle, resulting in \\\"serious\\\" or \\\"mask-like\\\" facial expressions. FSHD is usually slowly progressive; affected individuals often have normal life spans.

In individuals without facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, the D4Z4 region contains 11 to more than 100 repeating DNA segments. People with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy have a D4Z4 region with 10 or fewer repeats. This shortening somehow leads to the inappropriate activation of certain genes in skeletal muscle cells.  The deletion of a DNA segment called D4Z4 repetative element or D4Z4 36-mer is detectable only in B-lymphocytes of CLL patients with FSHD1.

The DUX4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that switches other genes on and off (a transcription factor) during the very early stages of embryonic development. After this stage, the DUX4 gene usually remains off (inactivated) and is not used to make protein in most tissues, including muscle.  Studies suggest that when the DUX4 gene is turned on in muscle cells, it may interfere with the process by which cells develop into their mature forms (differentiation) and lead to the disruption of structures and functions unique to muscle cells. This abnormal activity may cause muscle damage or make muscle cells more susceptible to additional types of damage, such as oxidative stress. Researchers believe that inappropriate activation of the DUX4 gene in muscle cells is a critical factor in causing muscle weakness and wasting in FSHD.  Human DNA can be divided into regions called chromosomes, which contain blocks of similarly sized repeated sequences of DNA known as polymorphic repeats or D4Z4 units. One of these blocks is located near the end of chromosome 4, in a region called 4q35. Studies have shown that the activation of the DUX4 gene is suppressed when this block of D4Z4 units contains more than 10 repeats. In contrast, activation of the DUX4 gene is associated with a reduction in the number of D4Z4 repeats to 1 to 10 units.  Researchers hypothesize that the copy number change in the repeat affects the gene activity through changing the condensation of chromatin. Chromatin is the combination of DNA and proteins that make up the contents of the nucleus of a cell, and its condensation affects gene expression. When chromatin is condensed (compact), genes are generally inactive, but they become active when chromatin is more relaxed (open). Though copy number change of the repeat is associated with changes in chromatin, it is unclear how these changes affect chromatin and gene expression in physiological and disease states, nor why muscle cells are primarily affected.  The SMCHD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in regulating the expression of many genes, including genes that are important for skeletal development and differentiation of cells into specialized types in the developing embryo. The SMCHD1 protein is also thought to be involved in regulating the activity of the DUX4 gene and preventing production of the DUX4 protein in some tissues, such as muscle.  Researchers suspect that a critical factor in developing FSHD is the inappropriate activation of the DUX4 gene and DUX4 protein production in muscle cells. In the absence of FSHD1, activation of the DUX4 gene is suppressed when a region near the end of chromosome 4 (4q35) is short (has 10 or fewer D4Z4 repeats) or due to sufficient SMCHD1 protein production. In FSHD1 or when SMCHD1 protein is reduced, DUX4 gene transcription may be turned on (activated) inappropriately, resulting in muscle weakness and wasting. However, activation of the DUX4 gene is not sufficient to cause FSHD1, and at least one other genetic factor is believed to contribute to causing the disease.

In people without this disease, the D4Z4 region contains multiple repeated sequences of DNA. Each repeated sequence is about 3,300 DNA building blocks (base pairs) long. People without neuromuscular problems typically have 11 to more than 100 repeated sequences in the D4Z4 region. In people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1, this region has only 1 to 10 repeated sequences. Researchers believe that reducing the number of repeated sequences in the D4Z4 region allows the inappropriate production of a protein called DUX4 in muscle cells.  DUX4 is produced in early embryonic development but is typically silenced in mature muscles. It is unclear why this protein is toxic to mature muscle cells, but excessive DUX4 is thought to contribute to muscle weakness and wasting.  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 is caused by mutations in a gene called SMCHD1. This gene encodes a protein that helps to keep the D4Z4 region tightly compacted (condensed). When the D4Z4 region remains condensed, DUX4 remains silenced. Mutations in the SMCHD1 gene interfere with the function of the SMCHD1 protein, allowing DUX4 to be produced in mature muscle cells and causing muscle weakness.  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 and type 2 are slightly different forms of the disease that cannot be distinguished based on signs and symptoms alone.

The FSHD gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 in an area called 4q35; however, the specific gene has not been identified. Researchers believe that there is a DNA sequence, called D4Z4, that is repeated many times on chromosome 4 and that is involved in FSHD.  It is not clear how many pieces make up this D4Z4 sequence. Each piece, called a repeat unit, is 3.3 kilobases in length. Prior to 2002, research on the D4Z4 sequence was limited by the fact that researchers did not know the number of repeats in people without FSHD. In 2002, researchers learned that a typical chromosome 4 has anywhere from 11 to 100 copies of the repeat, resulting in a segment of 36.3 to 330 kilobases. The segment appears to be shortened, consisting of 10 or fewer copies of the repeat, in people with FSHD.  The D4Z4 repeats are not involved in protein production (polypeptide synthesis). 4q35 is attached to the nuclear matrix (a type of structural protein in the nucleus that attaches to specific parts of the chromosome and appears to assist in gene regulation), while similar regions on other chromosomes lack this attachment. This suggests that the 4q35 region has unique roles within the nucleus. Because the D4Z4 region has been highly conserved during evolution, it may perform a function that is critical and that would be harmful to lose.  FSHD can be caused by small changes (mutations) in many parts of the region around and including the D4Z4 sequence.

In most people with FSHD1, the D4Z4 repeat array has been shortened to 1 to 10 repeats.  FSHD type 2 does not result from a contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array.  People who have FSHD also share a similarity in DNA called a specific haplotype in the region of chromosome 4 near the D4Z4 repeat array. This genetic feature is sometimes called a permissive haplotype, and it allows disease to occur. This feature distinguishes the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4 from a highly similar repeat array located on chromosome 10. If a D4Z4 repeat array is contracted on chromosome 10, FSHD does not occur. Only shortened D4Z4 repeat arrays on chromosome 4 result in FSHD, and only with the specific haplotype.  The genetic changes that cause FSHD remove or inactivate chemical modifications (epigenetic markers) that repress gene activity in the D4Z4 region on chromosome 4. These genetic and epigenetic changes, together with the presence of a specific haplotype, lead to production of a protein called DUX4.  Gene expression studies have shown that making DUX4 in muscles cells can cause problems with muscle function and repair. A second protein called SMCHD1, which helps regulate genes by keeping them turned off at certain times during development or in specific tissues, plays a key role in determining whether FSHD1 or FSHD2 will result. When there is a mutation in both copies of the SMCHD1 gene, individuals will have FSHD2 regardless of the size of the D4Z4 repeat array. When a mutation in one copy of SMCHD1 is inherited by someone whose D4Z4 repeat array is already shortened, FSHD1 will result.  FSHD1 and FSHD2 currently account for about 95 percent of all cases of FSHD. The genetic and epigenetic changes that cause the remaining cases are still unknown. It is estimated that abnormalities of the SMCHD1 gene, which has been found to modify FSHD1 and cause a third form of the disease, underlie about 80 percent of the remaining cases of FSHD.

Less commonly, affected individuals may develop a chronic skin condition called livedo reticularis or painful red patches on the legs called purpura fulminans. An abnormal blood clot can also cause strokes, heart attacks, or sudden death.   Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is caused by a change (mutation) in the F5 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor V that is involved in blood clotting. Factor V helps two other blood-clotting proteins (factors Xa and prothrombin) stick together (bind). Binding is important for the normal formation of a clot that can stop bleeding. When the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells) are activated as part of an immune response, a protein called activated protein C (APC) is released. APC cleaves, or cuts, factor V, preventing factor Xa and prothrombin from binding together and limiting the formation of a clot. The mutation responsible for factor V Leiden thrombophilia prevents factor V from being cleaved by APC. Without this regulation, the clotting proteins stick together more than they should, increasing the risk of abnormal blood clots.   Most individuals with factor V Leiden thrombophilia have one copy of the F5 gene mutation in each cell (heterozygous). These people have a five- to tenfold increased risk of blood clots in the veins. About 20 percent of individuals with one copy of the mutation never develop symptoms of the disorder.

These clots can reduce or block blood flow in veins in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) or travel to the lungs through the bloodstream (pulmonary embolism). If the deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism occur together, the blockage of blood flow is called venous thromboembolism. Other symptoms of factor V Leiden thrombophilia may include abnormal or repeated blood clots during pregnancy and problematic blood clots from birth (neonatal purpura fulminans). Factor V Leiden thrombophilia occurs in a heterozygous and homozygous form.  Factor V Leiden thrombophilia results from mutations in the F5 gene. The F5 gene mutations involved in heterozygous and homozygous factor V Leiden thrombophilia differ, and the two forms of this disorder vary with respect to severity. Individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden thrombophilia have a 50-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy and a 10-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis following use of hormonal contraceptives compared with women who do not have the factor V Leiden mutation. The risk of blood clot formation is even higher in individuals with two copies of the factor V Leiden mutation. Factor V Leiden thrombophilia was first described in 1994.  The human body's blood vessels are lined with a growth barrier called the endothelium. When the endothelium is penetrated or damaged, blood clots form to help stop bleeding. These clots are formed through the interaction of protein clotting factors (coagulation factors), which stimulate blood cells called platelets to produce fibrin and begin constricting to form scabs in the damaged, bleeding area. At the same time, the coagulation factors stimulate the formation of an enzyme called thrombin. If thrombin production were not limited, it would feed back to stimulate continuous formation of more thrombin, fibrin, and blood clots in an uncontrolled process. To prevent this, a coagulation factor called factor V stimulates the production of a protein called activated protein C (APC), which breaks down thrombin and controls or \\\"inactivates\\\" the formation of blood clots.  Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is caused by an F5 gene mutation that alters the protein it encodes in such a way that APC is unable to break down the altered factor V protein (also called factor Va). Normally, APC inactivates factor Va, which also has the effect of limiting the production of thrombin. When APC is unable to inactivate factor Va, an uncontrolled process leads to the excessive production of thrombin.

In people with DVT, these medicines decrease the formation of existing clots, prevent new clots from forming, and lower the risk of a life-threatening accumulation of clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). For people with factor V Leiden thrombophilia, anticoagulant treatment is generally continued until all predisposing factors have been resolved (for example, until a person recovers from an illness or major surgery, or women stops taking oral contraceptives). When the clotting event was severe or life-threatening, such as in a pulmonary embolism, lifetime anticoagulation therapy may be recommended. Prevention is the most important consideration for treating people with factor V Leiden thrombophilia because they have an increased tendency to form clots.

Autosomal dominant inheritance occurs when one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

FXIII circulates in the blood as a complex of two A chains and two B chains (a tetramer).

Cells that break down fibrin strands enter the area of the injury, triggering the repair process. The cross-linking of strands by activated FXIII is necessary for normal clotting and wound healing.

The APC gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in several important processes including cell division and adhesion, and the transmission of signals in several key signaling pathways, most notably the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling is evolutionarily conserved across animal species and is essential for normal development before birth. After birth, it is important for the renewal of cells within the intestine and other organs, and the repair of tissues following injury. The APC protein contributes to the regulation of a protein called beta-catenin, which is an essential component of Wnt signaling. The APC protein helps to maintain appropriate levels of beta-catenin (also known as CTNNB1) within cells. When Wnt signaling begins, beta-catenin can enter the nucleus, the compartment that contains the cell's DNA. Beta-catenin binds to specific proteins and together they activate or enhance the activity of certain genes. When Wnt signaling stops, beta-catenin leaves the nucleus and is rapidly degraded (broken down).  Mutations in the APC gene lead to a loss of regulation of beta-catenin, which results in the accumulation of beta-catenin within the cell. Beta-catenin enters the nucleus inappropriately and activates genes that influence cell growth, including the genes involved in the growth of polyps and cancer.  In people with attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, polyps usually begin to develop in the teenage years. In this condition, fewer than 100 polyps appear in the large intestine. Mutations that cause this condition are typically found at either end of the APC gene. These mutations preserve some of the normal function of the APC protein, which is thought to reduce the number of polyps in affected people.  In FAP, polyps usually begin to develop in late childhood or the teenage years. In FAP, more than 100 polyps typically appear in the large intestine, and some people have thousands of polyps. Mutations that cause FAP are most often found in the central region of the APC gene. These mutations result in a nonfunctional APC protein.  MUTYH-associated polyposis is caused by MUTYH gene mutations that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that people with the condition inherit two mutated copies of the gene, one from each parent. The MUTYH gene provides instructions for making a protein called MYH glycosylase, which acts in DNA repair. This protein removes DNA damage that would otherwise cause mutations in a gene called KRAS and the APC gene. Mutations in KRAS and the APC gene are associated with multiple colorectal adenomas and the cancer predisposition characteristic of FAP. When both copies of the MUTYH gene are mutated, DNA repair is impaired, which leads to the formation of multiple adenomas and an increased risk of cancer. (For more information about autosomal recessive inheritance, see the MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia.)  In some cases, no genetic cause of polyposis can be identified.

However, when cells no longer respond to these signals, a mass of cells (tumor) can form. A disruption in this pathway is responsible for the development of the colon polyps seen in people with FAP. Some of these polyps may become malignant (cancerous), leading to the development of colorectal cancer.  Mutations in the APC gene that cause FAP lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the APC protein.

In people who have familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited mutation in one copy of the APC gene greatly increases the likelihood that adenomas will form. Most people with this condition have this gene mutation in all cells of the body, including colon cells. During an affected person's lifetime, if the second copy of the gene in a particular colon cell acquires a mutation, that cell may begin dividing in an uncontrolled way and form an adenoma. The APC protein normally prevents excess cell growth, so when the gene is mutated, uncontrolled growth is more likely to be triggered by additional mutations.

Because the protein is unable to carry out its functions effectively, growth and division of polyps in the large intestine and other tumors in the body occur.  A small number of familial adenomatous polyposis cases are due to mutations in the MUTYH gene instead of the APC gene. The MUTYH gene produces a protein that works together with several other proteins to correct errors in DNA. DNA is the chemical in our cells that carries genetic information for the growth, development, and functioning of the body. When DNA is copied (replicated) during cell division, errors sometimes occur, resulting in the insertion of the wrong sequence of chemical building blocks (bases). This alteration in DNA is called a mutation. The MUTYH protein helps correct DNA replication errors by removing adenine bases that have been incorrectly paired with guanine bases. Mutations in both copies of the MUTYH gene lead to a shortage of functional MUTYH protein, resulting in a reduced capacity to repair errors in DNA.

Many of these genes encode proteins that form pores (ion channels) in the membrane of heart cells. These channels allow positively charged atoms (ions) such as sodium, potassium, and calcium to pass into and out of the cells. This ion movement generates the tiny electrical impulses that trigger heartbeats. Other proteins change the electrical properties of heart cells by moving ions against the concentration gradient, transporting ions from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. Mutations in genes such as KCNQ1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2,which all involve potassium ion channels,SCN5A, which encodes a sodium ion channel, orCACNA1C, which codes for a calcium ion channelcan lead to abnormal electrical impulses and an irregular heartbeat.  Genetic changes that cause familial atrial fibrillation can also occur in genes that do not work through ion channels. Mutations in a gene called NPPAthat provides instructions for a hormone involved in regulating the body's water, salt, and fat balanceare responsible for this form of the condition. A decrease in the amount of this hormone, which helps control heart activity, may affect heart rhythm. Additionally, genetic changes in the gene encoding the ZFHX3 protein have been associated with familial atrial fibrillation. This protein is believed to turn on and off (regulate) multiple genes, including the NPPA gene. Variations in ZFHX3 may influence the development of familial atrial fibrillation by altering activity in a heart-related pathway regulated by ZFHX3. Researchers look for associations of DNA variations with a disease. Not every variation in a gene will cause a disease or condition; some variations are common in the population and have no effect on health.

These channels are known as potassium ion channels because they allow the flow of potassium (K) ions out of the cells. Neighboring ions with opposite charges, such as sodium ions, are simultaneously able to flow into the cells through different channels. This exchange of charged particles establishes an electric current, which is transmitted from cell to cell and triggers a wave of contraction that causes the heart to beat.  Mutations in the KCNQ1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2 genes appear to convert the resulting potassium ion channels so that they lack specificity and allow sodium ions to flow both into and out of cells. Without the flow of potassium ions, electric current transmission is altered, and the wave of contraction becomes disorganized, resulting in atrial fibrillation.  The causes of familial atrial fibrillation in many affected families remain unknown.

Most of the identified genes play a role in controlling the normal rhythm of the heart; changes in these genes can disrupt the movements that transmit signals between heart cells.  The PRKAG2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This enzyme takes part in a critical cellular energy-sensing pathway. AMPK adds a phosphate group to (phosphorylates) certain proteins to regulate their activity; it consists of three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) that must be assembled into a complex before the enzyme can function. The specific subunit produced from each gene determines the enzyme's characteristics. The gamma-2 subunit encoded by the PRKAG2 gene is normally found in skeletal and heart muscle.  NPPA provides instructions for making a protein called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). This protein works to control blood pressure by signaling the muscles in blood vessel walls to relax, which increases the flow of blood and lowers pressure, as well as by increasing the amount of salt (sodium) and water excreted in the urine. ANP helps control the movement of ions across membranes, which is important for regulating the normal rhythmic heartbeat.  MYL4 provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein called myosin. Myosin is the major contractile protein in muscle and is involved in muscle contraction. The specific subunit produced from each gene is specific to a particular muscle type. The myosin subunit produced from the MYL4 gene is found in the embryonic (developing) heart; most of this protein is replaced in the adult heart by a closely related version, which is produced from a similar gene (MYL3). Some MYL4 protein is present in the adult heart, though its function is not well understood.  The gene involved in the condition that is associated with the region 10q22-q24 has not been identified.

Familial dysautonomia is one of a group of conditions called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs). These disorders are characterized by progressive damage to nerves of the peripheral nervous system (the network of nerves beyond the brain and spinal cord). Depending on the type of HSAN, loss of sensory nerve function interferes with the perception of pain and temperature. The autonomic nerves that are affected in these conditions regulate certain involuntary body functions such as blood pressure, breathing, and digestion. Autonomic nerve damage causes weakness of specific muscles used in swallowing and changes in tear and saliva production. Other resulting symptoms can include hypotension (low blood pressure), loss of the gag reflex, dulled perception of pain, and limited ability to sweat.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The term familial dysautonomia describes a group of signs and symptoms resulting from the abnormal development and degeneration of certain nerve cells.

Most types are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; one type is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.  Erythrocytosis may also be classified as primary or secondary, depending on the underlying cause. Primary erythrocytosis happens when abnormalities of the bone marrow (where red blood cells are made) lead to increased red cell production.

Because the inheritance and underlying mechanisms differ for each type of familial erythrocytosis, they are often described separately. Most types of familial erythrocytosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. One type (type 4) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Most types of erythrocytosis are due to underlying abnormalities that lead to decreased delivery of oxygen (hypoxia) to the kidneys. In response, the kidneys make and secrete increased amounts of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO), which acts as a growth factor for red blood cells. The elevated EPO stimulates the bone marrow to produce erythrocytes in excess of the number the body needs. Scientists have discovered that changes (mutations) in various genes are responsible for different types of erythrocytosis. These genes are involved in both the body's response to hypoxia and the growth of erythrocytes.  Familial erythrocytosis type 1 is caused by mutations in the EPOR gene. The EPOR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an erythropoietin receptor. This receptor is found on the surface of certain bone marrow cells. The receptor catches erythropoietin molecules and passes their signals to these cells to stimulate the production of mature erythrocytes.  EPOR gene mutations produce an altered erythropoietin receptor that is abnormally sensitive to erythropoietin stimulation. Individuals with this condition usually have increased red blood cell production without an increase in erythropoietin levels.  Familial erythrocytosis type 3 is caused by mutations in the BPGM gene. The BPGM gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps regulate oxygen release from hemoglobin molecules. A mutation in the BPGM gene can lead to abnormal hemoglobin with increased affinity (tendency) to bind oxygen, which results in less oxygen release to body tissues. Frequent oxygen sensing leads to an increase of erythropoietin, which increases production of red blood cells.  The gene responsible for type 4 familial erythrocytosis has not been identified. Haploinsufficiency of two neighboring genes in the deleted region are suspected to play a role in the erythrocytosis and other signs and symptoms of this disorder.

Therefore, the number of red blood cells in the blood is increased if either there is a shortage of oxygen (hypoxia) and the body tries to compensate, or an abnormality occurs in the production of red blood cells.  For most cases of familial erythrocytosis, low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia) stimulate the release of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO).

Most mutations that cause familial erythrocytosis alter the production of erythropoietin without affecting its ability to stimulate red blood cell production. These mutations can increase the production of erythropoietin or its action on the bone marrow, resulting in excess red blood cells. Alternatively, the genetic changes can trick the body into thinking that it needs to increase erythropoietin production, even when red blood cell levels are normal. This is the case with a mutation in the HBB gene, which alters the hemoglobin produced by the red blood cells and impairs the cells' ability to use oxygen.

When oxygen levels return to normal, erythropoietin levels decrease and red blood cell production returns to normal. Erythropoietin production is regulated by a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which is made up of two subunits: alpha and beta. Under normal conditions, HIF alpha subunits are marked for destruction by proteins produced from the VHL gene. During hypoxia, HIF alpha subunits bind to the beta subunits to form the active HIF protein, which stimulates erythropoietin production.Unlike HIF beta, HIF alpha subunits are highly sensitive to blood oxygen levels. HIF alpha activity is enhanced by the protein made from the EPAS1 gene (also known as endothelial PAS domain protein 1) and suppressed by the protein made from the EGLN1 gene (also known as prolyl hydroxylase 2).

The thickness of the blood may also increase the risk of developing a blood clot (thrombus), which could lead to a life-threatening heart attack or stroke with serious injury or death. Additional medical problems caused by erythrocytosis are rare, but they may be serious. For example, an abnormally high number of red blood cells can cause a decrease in the amount of oxygen that reaches delicate areas in the brain and other organs, and certain loss-of-function mutations in the genes for oxygen sensing cause decreases in hormone levels that regulate oxygen in the airways so it is hard for oxygen to travel from the lungs to the rest of the body.

Although most cases occur sporadically (in people with no history of the disorder in their family), the autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked recessive forms accounts for about 50 to 60 percent of cases. Less than 50 percent of autosomal dominant FEVR is caused by changes (mutations) in one of the known associated genes, indicating that there are other genes not yet identified responsible for this condition.

A gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in eye development, especially the formation of blood vessels in the retina. This role is important during fetal development, but these blood vessels are also thought to be maintained and refortified throughout life. Times of refortification could include removing areas that are damaged or blocked and making new blood vessels to replace them. The proteins produced from the FEVR-related genes likely continue to play a role in this retinal blood vessel refortification after birth. Mutations in these genes can disrupt blood vessel development and remodeling, resulting in the signs and symptoms of FEVR.  The following genes are involved in FEVR:  NDP. Mutations in the NDP gene cause the X-linked recessive form of FEVR. NDP provides instruction for making a protein called norrin, which activates cell-signaling pathways needed for the development and maintenance of the retinal blood vessels. Mutations in this gene likely disrupt norrin signaling, impairing the formation of retinal blood vessels.  FZD4. The FZD4 gene is one of several genes that help carry out the cell-signaling pathways activated by the norrin protein. The protein produced from the FZD4 gene, called frizzled-4, is a cell surface receptor, which means that it spans the outer membrane surrounding a cell. Frizzled-4 binds to norrin, which triggers a series of events inside the cell that helps regulate the formation of retinal blood vessels. Mutations in the FZD4 gene can impair frizzled-4 function, affecting norrin signaling and retinal blood vessel formation.  LRP5. The protein produced from the LRP5 gene, called low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, also helps carry out the cell signaling triggered by norrin. Mutations in the LRP5 gene generally decrease levels of the transformation growth factor beta, or TGF-\u00df, whose cellsignaling pathway is activated by norrin and is involved in the regulation of retinal blood vessel development.  TSPAN12. The protein produced from the TSPAN12 gene, called tetraspanin 12, also plays a role in norrin signaling. Although the precise function of tetraspanin 12 is unknown, studies suggest that it promotes the interaction between norrin and frizzled-4, which is needed to turn on cell signaling pathways. Tetraspanin 12 may also have additional roles in blood vessel formation that are not well understood.

In some cases, FEVR is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern or an X-linked recessive pattern.  FZD4, LRP5, and TSPAN12 genes produce proteins that form a signaling pathway, called the Wnt (wingless-type) signaling pathway, that controls growth of blood vessels in developing tissues.

A mutation in one of these genes can impair activation of the pathway or transmission of signals through the pathway, which slows the formation of the blood vessels in the retina.

If a couple is healthy enough for sexual intercourse, and has sexual intercourse without using any form of birth control, it is normal for woman to not get pregnant every month. It can take months for some couples. If after a year, they are still not pregnant, they should see their doctor and be tested and treated if needed.    For about 1 in 3 of infertile couples, there is a problem with the man. Often the problem is not being able to make enough sperm. In about 1 in 3 cases, there is a problem with the woman.

Screening recommendations vary according to risk factors. People at average risk of colorectal cancer should begin screening from ages 45 to 50. Appropriate screening tests include:       - Regular colonoscopy every 10 years    - Colonoscopy every 5 years plus an annual stool test, if there is a family history of cancer    - A double-contrast barium enema or virtual colonoscopy every 5 years    - CT colonography every 5 years    - Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 3 to 5 years.

In the bloomery, the iron had a spongy consistency (hence its name) and was therefore called a \\\"bloom\\\". Once removed from the furnace, the bloom was pounded to break up the grains of steel (pattern welding). Blister steel was converted to what was (in that time) called shear steel by packing the blister steel in a leather bag, welding it shut and then piling a large weight on top of the bag to squeeze the blister into shear steel.

It happens when levels of bilirubin become too high in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fats. When old red blood cells are recycled, the liver filters out the bilirubin and it passes through the liver into the intestines.    Newborn babies can develop jaundice because their bodies make more red blood cells than they need. These extra cells are broken down, creating extra bilirubin. Also, their livers are less able to get rid of bilirubin. Jaundice appears in newborns as yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. It usually shows up between the second and fourth day of life. The condition tends to last longer in breastfed babies than in formula-fed infants.    For adults, there are many possible causes of jaundice. They include       - Blockage of the bile duct by a gallstone    - Diseases of red blood cells    - Viral hepatitis    - Cancer of the pancreas    - Cirrhosis of the liver    - Alcohol abuse       Other symptoms may point to the cause of adult jaundice.

The liver normally excretes bilirubin, but in jaundice it builds up faster than the liver can break it down. This causes the yellow discoloration. There are three main types of jaundice, classified by how they occur:       - Prehepatic jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin in the blood. This can happen if there is rapid breakdown of red blood cells due to a genetic disease or reaction to medications. It can also be caused by increased bilirubin production by bacteria in the bowel. It is often only seen in laboratory tests.    - Hepatic jaundice happens when there is a problem with the liver cells, such as in cirrhosis, viral hepatitis or cancer that results in a buildup of bilirubin. This type of jaundice can be acute or chronic.      - Posthepatic jaundice results from an obstruction of the bile duct, often caused by either stones in the gallbladder or cancer. People with this type of jaundice can have dark urine, as well as very light-colored (make sure to ask your doctor to investigate.)       Other causes of jaundice include liver cancer, hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, sickle cell disease or cystic fibrosis.

Malignant cells form flat areas under the skin and form dark red or purple patches. In advanced Kaposi's sarcoma, the cancer cells are abnormal and may form lumps, nodules, or lesions. The lumps in advanced Kaposi's sarcoma change the structure and function of the skin and tissues under the skin.    Over time, the cancer cells spread and damage blood vessels and lymph vessels. When this happens, the skin becomes swollen and sore. Blocks in lymph vessels may cause lymphedema, in which excess tissue fluid collects and causes swelling in the tissues. Blocked lymph vessels may also cause scarring and hardening of the skin, which slows blood flow to the skin. This may cause the skin tissue to die.   Kaposi's sarcoma can affect the following:         -  Skin.     -  Mucous membranes (mouth lining, nose, and throat).     -  Lymph nodes.     -  Digestive system.     -  Lungs.

In most people, herpes viruses do not cause illness. However, in people who have a weakened immune system, herpes viruses can cause illness.   Kaposi's sarcoma is more common in people who have a weakened immune system. Types of immunosuppression in which Kaposi's sarcoma may occur include:         - Having HIV infection.    - Taking immunosuppressive drugs, such as after organ transplant.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Four types of Kaposi's sarcoma are described:\\n                    Classic Kaposi's Sarcoma       Classic Kaposi's sarcoma occurs most often in men of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Eastern European Jewish descent. This type of Kaposi's sarcoma begins as sores on the lower legs and go away and come back over time. Endoscopy and x-rays of the intestine should be part of the initial evaluation of all patients with classic Kaposi's sarcoma in order to check for sores that are not causing symptoms. These sores do not go away and often get worse. Significant lymphedema also occurs in advanced cases of classic Kaposi's sarcoma. In this type of Kaposi's sarcoma, the patient's immune system is normal and the patient is not infected with HIV. Endemic (In African Young Men) Kaposi's Sarcoma       Endemic Kaposi's sarcoma occurs in men and women (who may be HIV-positive or HIV-negative) in eastern and central Africa. This type of Kaposi's sarcoma is more common in people who have a weak immune system. In women who become pregnant, migration of the Kaposi's sarcoma cells into deeper tissues in their body may be faster. In this type of Kaposi's sarcoma, the patient may be infected with HIV, the patient's immune system may be weak, or the patient may be infected with HIV and have a weak immune system. Iatrogenic (transplant-related) Kaposi's Sarcoma       Iatrogenic Kaposi's sarcoma can develop in people who are taking medicines to weaken the immune system (for example, after an organ transplant). In this type of Kaposi's sarcoma, the patient's immune system is very weak and the patient is not infected with HIV. Epidemic (HIV-related) Kaposi's Sarcoma       Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer in people with AIDS. In people with AIDS it has been thought that Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by the Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus and worsened by the effect of AIDS on the immune system. However, recent studies show that in people with AIDS, the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma may be the Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus, the effect of AIDS on the immune system, or both. People with AIDS who have Kaposi's sarcoma also have a higher risk of primary effusion lymphoma.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels. The disease usually appears as tumors on the skin or on mucosal surfaces such as inside the mouth, but tumors can also develop in other parts of the body, including lymph nodes, lungs, and digestive tract. The tumors (lesions) are usually purple and contain abnormally shaped blood vessels. The blood vessels allow blood to pool, which is why the lesions look purple. The tumors are sometimes painful, but they don't usually itch.  There are 5 types of Kaposi's sarcoma:  - Classic Kaposi's sarcoma: a rare type of Kaposi's sarcoma in older individuals who live in the Mediterranean, Middle East, or Eastern European area of the world. Classic Kaposi's sarcoma is more common and more severe in men than it is in women. The disease begins as lesions on the lower limbs and progresses slowly. People with this type of Kaposi's sarcoma usually live many years with their disease. This form of Kaposi's sarcoma usually does not respond well to chemotherapy. - African (endemic) Kaposi's sarcoma: a type of Kaposi's sarcoma that occurs in people native to Africa. It occurs in a lymph-node form that is often fatal in children and a classical form that occurs in adults.  - Immunosuppressant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma: a type of Kaposi's sarcoma that occurs in people taking immunosuppressant drugs. It is a severe form of Kaposi's sarcoma that occurs most frequently following organ transplant. - Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome - associated Kaposi's sarcoma: a severe, rapidly progressive type of Kaposi's sarcoma that occurs in people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is the most common type of AIDS-related cancer and is often the first sign that a person has AIDS. AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma is the most aggressive form of Kaposi's sarcoma.  Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) causes Kaposi's sarcoma. Infection with the HHV-8 virus does not necessarily lead to Kaposi's sarcoma, but you are more likely to develop Kaposi's sarcoma if you have the HHV-8 virus and one of the following risk factors: - Older, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, or Eastern European - Have AIDS - Take immunosuppressive drugs after organ transplantation Images of Kaposi's Sarcoma Skin lesions in Kaposi's sarcoma may be one of the following:   - Purple to brown-red nodules    - Raised flat lesions    - Plaques, which are solid, raised areas on the skin - Skin: Kaposi's sarcoma most commonly occurs on the skin. Lesions in classic Kaposi's sarcoma usually appear on the feet, ankles, and lower legs. While lesions in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma can appear anywhere on the skin, they most commonly occur on the face and inside the mouth. The lesions can occur alone or in clusters. They usually start as flat, painless purple, pink, or red areas. Over time, the spots may become raised and hardened and may turn brown.   - Mucous membranes: Lesions can also occur in the mucous membranes, most commonly in the mouth. Lesions in the mouth usually occur on the hard palate but can occur on the gums, tongue, and other areas. They begin as swelling of the mucous membrane, which then changes color and becomes ulcerated.   Occasionally, Kaposi's sarcoma may begin in other parts of the body such as in the stomach or intestines, lungs, or lymphatic system.

In non-identical twins, the new kidney would work for a while, but gradually devastated by the immune system. The first successful non-twin kidney transplants used large doses of corticosteroids to suppress the immune system. Dr. Thomas Starzl of Denver developed the first practical kidney transplant using azathioprine and corticosteroids to suppress the immune system. Azathioprine quiets the immune system and makes it much less likely to reject a transplanted organ. It may also help prevent the onset of certain types of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroids help to suppress the immune system by preventing the production and actions of many chemical messengers in the body.

People with dementia with Lewy bodies also develop visual hallucinations, tremors and rigidity, and slow movements. Individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies usually begin to show movement difficulties and cognitive changes within a year of each other.  In Parkinson's disease, the death of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra (midbrain) begins earlier than in other brain regions, resulting in a shortage of the important brain chemical dopamine. As a result, people with Parkinson's disease develop movement problems such as muscle stiffness, tremor, sound freezing (akinesia), poor balance, and slow movement. When people with Parkinson's disease later experience severe dementia, they are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease dementia.  Studies using brain imaging have found differences between Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, although the two disorders share many features and can only definitively be distinguished by examining brain tissue after death.  People who have mostly movement problems caused by the loss of dopamine nerve cells (such as Parkinson's disease) usually have symptoms later. When brain cell loss is primarily related to a shortage of acetylcholine (another brain chemical that transmits messages between nerve cells) and affects the cerebral cortex (the part of the brain responsible for memory, attention to task, language, and perception) sooner, a person is more likely to develop dementia in the earlier stages of the disease.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Lewy body disease is a form of dementia that causes a progressive decline in your mental abilities.

The following tests and procedures may be used:         - Physical exam and history.     -  Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -  Complete blood count (CBC) : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.            - Liver function tests: A blood test to measure the blood levels of certain substances released by the liver. A blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver.    -  Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as alpha fetoprotein (AFP), released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. The sample is checked to see how much of a tumor marker is present. Sometimes, the tumor marker being checked may be used to help diagnose the type of tumor, and other times the tumor marker is used to see how well treatment is working.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America than in the United States. In these areas where hepatocellular carcinoma is common, the risk for this cancer is increased by eating foods that have a type of fungus that causes cells to become cancer (carcinogenic). Certain caricinogens, also called cancer-causing agents, in foods and in the air and water may increase the risk of developing cancer.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, cancer cells travel through the blood or lymph system.         Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma    Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma forms in cells that line the small bile ducts in the liver and is one of the most common cancers affecting the bile ducts. Cancer of the bile ducts may also form outside the liver.     Hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma often occur together in the same liver. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is more common in people who have a liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis. Other risk factors for getting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include using birth control pills and taking a supplement called Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), which was used in the past to help diagnose certain liver diseases. Most patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have a high patient participation score; electrical stimulation does not improve this score.    Cancer may form in parts of the liver other than one of the two types of liver cancer.

The lungs are made of spongy tissue and are surrounded by a membrane called the pleura.    When you breathe, air moves through the nose, into the trachea, which divides into the right and left bronchus. Each bronchus enters a lung and then divides several times becoming smaller and smaller. The smallest airways end in clusters of tiny air sacs, called alveoli. It is in the alveoli that fresh oxygen from the air is exchanged with the waste gas, carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the alveoli and is breathed out. Cancer cells begin to grow within the lung in these airways, alveoli, or the pleura and may spread through the lymph system or the bloodstream to other parts of the body.    Lung cancer may affect one or both lungs, damage the airways, and make it hard to breathe. Treatment for lung cancer may harm healthy lung tissue. When a diagnosis of lung cancer is made, the patient and doctor should decide on treatment together. Doctors and patients weigh the risks of having treatment, such as surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy that may damage healthy lung tissue, versus the chance it can help the patient and how the patient may feel during and after treatment.

Of these, over 9,900 cases are expected from non-white racial groups (e.g., African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans). It is estimated that over 9,900 people will die of melanoma this year; about 1,800 of those who died were from non-white racial groups.   For more information, see the Skin Cancer and Melanoma Skin Cancer Treatment summaries.   Skin color can affect the risk of developing melanoma. All skin has some protection from ultraviolet (UV) rays because skin makes melanin from special pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Melanin is a substance that gives color to the skin and eyes, and helps protect the skin from UV radiation. People who have dark skin make more melanin than people with light skin. The extra melanin protects some people of color from the effects of UV radiation and from skin cancer.    However, skin cancer can happen to anyone. People with dark skin can get skin cancer in places not exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. These include the nailbeds, on the sides of fingers and toes, or in the lining of the mouth. and people with dark skin are more likely to die of skin cancer. Skin cancer is more likely to be found late in people who have dark skin, leading to fewer treatment options and a worse prognosis.     Skin cancer, including melanoma, may look different on people who have dark skin. For example:         - Basal cell carcinoma may be black or brown, instead of clear, pink, pearl, or brown.     - Squamous cell carcinoma may be dark brown or black, instead of red, pink, or brown.     - Seborrheic keratosis (\\\"barnacle\\\") may be brown or black, instead of tan, yellow, or light brown.          Melanoma can form in places that get little or no sun, such as under the nails, on the palms of the hands, or on the soles of the feet.
