The amount each defendant pays is up to the jury. It usually depends on the degree of fault of each defendant.     For example, a jury finds that Ms. Y owes Mr. X $200,000 for damages he suffered in an auto accident. If there were two defendants, the jury may decide that the first is 60 percent at fault and the second is 40 percent at fault. Each defendant then pays according to his degree of fault. The first pays $120,000, which is 60 percent of $200,000. The second pays $80,000, which is 40 percent of $200,000.

Joint and several liability      Under joint and several liability, all the wrongdoers can be sued together as a group or each can be sued individually.    If the wrongdoers are sued together, a court or jury will decide how much the injured party should recover. That amount may be divided among the wrongdoers according to the amount of blame they have or fixed equally. If one or more wrongdoers cannot or do not pay their part of the damages, the rest must pay the difference.     If the wrongdoers are sued individually, the injured party must prove in each case the damages caused to him/her. If the wrongdoers are not equally liable, the financial liability of a wrongdoer may be more than the liability of other wrongdoers, depending on how much the court or jury finds a wrongdoer contributed to the damage. Under joint and several liability, if other wrongdoers cannot or do not pay their share, the wrongdoer must pay the difference.    The advantage to the injured person is that joint and several liability increases the likelihood that the injured party will be able to recover all the damages to which he or she is entitled. Joint and several liability is the traditional method used in most courts.     Several liability     Under several liability, each wrongdoer is responsible only for the amount of damage that he or she caused.

Ratification means that a corporate officer, manager, or managing agent knew what was going on and did nothing to stop it including the power to stop what was going on.    In California, the determination of whether punitive damages will be awarded is a separate trial from the trial to determine liability and compensatory damages. If the jury finds by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for punitive damages and that the alleged conduct was committed by or engaged in under the authority or ratification of a responsible corporate officer or managing agent or was a part of a pattern or practice of malice or oppression, then the court will conduct a trial to determine the amount of the punitive damage award.

Researchers have been searching for the causes of mental illness for nearly a hundred years. We used to think that mental illness was a reaction to difficulty in life. Indeed, anxiety and depression may be reasonable responses to losing a loved one, losing a job, being bullied, or having any number of other difficult events. However, for millions of Americans, anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders are serious illnesses that cause more than sadness or temporary worry. They are characterized by feelings of terror, despair, and hopelessness that do not go away and make it difficult for the person to function in daily life. These individuals need treatment from a mental health professional.    Today, we know that certain kinds of mental illness are linked to specific abnormal messages between nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. We also know that many mental illnesses run in families, so the things we inherit from our parents must have some effect. Research shows that mental disorders can result from a number of causes including genetic factors; certain events in early life such as infections, diet, stress or exposure to toxins that affect brain development; and changes that occur later in life.    Brain changes associated with mental disorders may be chemical, structural, or both. It remains unclear if these brain changes are the cause or the effect of mental disorders.

The court held that a fiduciary relationship does exist, quoting from Wheaton v. Wheaton, 4 Paige 32:       \\\"(The parties stood) in such a relation to each other, that the one must not, without the other's express consent, adopt any measure respecting the thing which is the subject of the confidence, or act in any manner concerning it, otherwise than for the other's benefit ...\\\"    That is why the duty of loyalty is one of the most important parts of a fiduciary relationship.

Jur. 2d Escrows \u00a7 16 provides a nice overview on the Duties of an Escrow Holder: An escrow holder has a duty to follow the terms of the escrow agreement and generally does not have discretion to refuse a tender which the escrow agreement requires it to accept. It is not bound to act as the agent of one party to the exclusion of the other, and cannot therefore lawfully pay out the escrow to one party, when the other has offered to perform the acts on which payment is to be conditional. An escrow is regarded as a fund or res which the escrowee is to hold for the mutual benefit of the parties to the escrow. Accordingly, an escrow holder may refuse to deliver the escrow property unless the parties authorize the delivery or its terms so provide. If neither party is entitled to the property, the escrow may still be held, and the escrow holder may be held liable if he releases it to a party who is not entitled thereto. A party who has received property from the escrow holder under a mistaken interpretation of his rights under an escrow agreement must restore it to the escrow if it has not been delivered and a different disposition of the property is thus not prevented. If the receipt thereof has prevented a further delivery, the other party may not recover compensation from that party for the amount of the property. One who receives property from an escrow to which he is not then entitled to is estopped to deny that he has received it. Unless otherwise agreed, an escrow holder is entitled to reasonable compensation for his services, and he has a lien for such compensation upon the property held in escrow.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Authorities that address duties of escrow holder include the following: Fam.

This is because a speculative investor is one who consciously accepts a higher degree of risk than an average investor. Speculative investments have a higher degree of risk, a lower degree of liquidity, and/or a less certain prospect of income than non-speculative investments.  Speculative securities generally are not suitable for a conservative individual who can afford to lose only a small part of his or her investment portfolio. However, speculative securities may be suitable in limited amounts for an individual with assets sufficient to maintain a conservative level of investments to meet financial goals and who has sufficient income and networth to withstand a substantial loss of the speculative investment.  While all of the decisions an investor makes can affect how likely it is that the investor will be able to reach his or her investment goals, in some circumstances it is more important to be concerned about specific types of investment risks. Some of the most important risks to be concerned about in speculative securities include the company risk, which is the risk that the company issuing the security will lose value; and the risk that an individual security system in the portfolio will lose value.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"A stockbroker who sells you a speculative security has a duty to perform a reasonable investigation into the security before recommending it to you.

There are various ways in which the landlord may give such advance notice to the tenant, including certified mail and personal delivery. Each method must meet certain criteria, such as a personal delivery (where the landlord or landlord's agent must actually hand the written notice to the tenant). Maryland law further provides for the presumed receipt of such termination notice. Under the statute, a written notice mailed by certified mail shall be presumed to have been received by the addressee on the earlier to occur of (i) its actual receipt or (ii) the fifth day after the day on which it was mailed. Cases interpreting this statute have held that service, like any other element of a landlord's complaint, must be proven sufficient in a landlord's unlawful detainer action. If the landlord fails to prove that the tenant was properly served, the landlord cannot recover possession of the property because, without sufficient notice of the termination, the tenancy continues.

Following is a summary of the results found: In Aylward v. Town of Greenburgh, 594 F.3d 72 (2nd Cir. 2010), the court explained that a plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of failure to provide reasonable accommodation by showing that (1) the plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA, (2) the employer had notice of the plaintiff's disability, (3) with reasonable accommodation, the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the position, and (4) the employer refused to make such accommodations. There were four applicable exemptions to the ADA: religious exemptions, exemptions for Indian tribes, exemptions for the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, and the \\\"bona fide occupational qualification\\\" exemption. Nothing in the Zinnerman case indicated that a defendant could raise failure to provide reasonable accommodation as an affirmative defense and, therefore, the claim that an employer was entitled to such a defense was without merit. The quote with the closest application of \\\"failure to reasonably accommodate\\\" was in Warren County Township v. Wilke, 936 F.2d 689 (7th Cir. 1991). The court said that a state's rehabilitation law must require an employer to make reasonable accommodations for its disabled employees in order for the law to satisfy the ADA amendment's exemption for laws that govern workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, or \\\"other insurance.\\\" The phrase \\\"reasonable accommodation\\\" also appeared in the decision in Hines v. Hills Dept. Store, 60 F.2d 399 (4th Cir. 1995). In that opinion, the court found that where \\\"the evidence, considered in a light most favorable to the appellant, failed to demonstrate any adverse employment action based on a failure to reasonably accommodate a disability,\\\" summary judgment should have been granted in favor of the employer. Two other cases where the court spoke of \\\"reasonable accommodation\\\" were in Kelley v. Metro. Ctr. for Mental Health, 519 F.Supp.2d 94 (D.C. Cir. 2007) and in Perez v. El Tepeyac Butcher Shop, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158122 (N.D. Ill. 2014). In both cases, the courts decided that the fact that a plaintiff's need for accommodation was based on a religious belief, was no reason to require a reasonable accommodation. The courts relied on the provision in the ADA that a \\\"religion\\\" or \\\"religious practice\\\" does not include a \\\"moral or ethical belief . . . .\\\" Lawriter Ohio Administrative Code 4112-5-08 entitled \\\"Reasonble Accommodations\\\", \\\"Examining Accommodation Requests\\\" provides background overview of the best practices under the Ohio Civil Rights Statute.

Normally when one sues for defamation, the person must prove that the statement was false and that the one who made it was negligent (he or she did not use enough care to make sure the statement was true).

Trade Secret vs. Copyright vs. Patent Copyright, patents, and trade secrets are all ways of protecting intellectual property (IP). The main difference between them is that copyright and patent law protect what is known to the public, while trade secret law helps keep certain things secret. With copyright and patent protection, you must disclose what they are. For example, when you patent a new kind of pen, you disclose how it works. You get the exclusive right to make, use, or sell that pen for a limited time. Trade secret protection does not have a time limit, but you can lose the protection. If you disclose the secret, somebody else finds out about it, or makes it on their own, it is no longer protected. When you develop a new pen, you do not tell anybody how it works. If somebody finds out how it works, you can no longer protect it.    Trade secret law has the fewest restrictions on what kind of knowledge can be protected. Copyright law only protects expression, so it does not protect ideas, facts, systems, or methods of operation. Patent law protects inventions and only protects the specific ways to accomplish your result, but you have to let the public know what those ways are. Trade secret law protects formulas, patterns, physical devices, and iterated recipes for getting a certain result, but only if they remain secret. DuckDuckGo's search algorithm is a trade secret. Underdigitalized is not a trade secret. The fact that it is underdigitalized is publicly known. Trade Secret Protection Trade secret protection lasts as long as the secret keeps its economic value from not being generally known. Once a trade secret is stolen, it is usually hard to get it back and the owner often loses the competitive advantage. Good trade secret protection requires that a company treat a secret as economic property by having adequate physical and electronic security, supervising employees, limiting access to the secret, and training employees on security and how to protect trade secrets. It also means having good contracts with employees and contractors that include confidentiality and noncompetition clauses.   DTSA, UTSA, and EEA Trade secret law varies by state. Some states passed trade secret laws before 1979, but in 1979, a group of state lawmakers developed a model act to unify the trade secret laws of the states. They called this the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, (UTSA) and it has been updated a few times to keep up with the times. Forty-five states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have all adopted this law, some with slight variations, some without.    When Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA), it made trade secret misappropriation a federal crime. This was primarily to address economic espionage. In 2016, Congress passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA). This law permits a company to file civil trade secret misappropriation claims in federal court.

Degenshein v. Seinfeld  In the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, a doctor sued a comedian, alleging that he stole his idea for a fictional character and used it on his television show. Degenshein had previously performed as a stand-up comedian under the stage name Andy Kopfgstatz and invented the character \\\"Fat MacArthur,\\\" a tour guide at the United Nations, for his act. Jerry Seinfeld portrayed a character that shared some similarities with the doctor on an episode of Seinfeld as a United Nations tour guide: McDonald. The complaint alleged that Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David \\\"misappropriated plaintiff's goodwill\\\" by incorporating the character into one episode of Seinfeld. Degenshein also alleged violations of the right of publicity, the Lanham Act, unfair competition, common law misappropriation, and tortious interference with employment agreements.   The court dismissed the complaint. The court noted that the United Nations tour guide character was one of many on Seinfeld who were \\\"clearly...broad parodies intended to poke fun at various facets of human nature,\\\" and that there is no indication that the episode \\\"targeted, referred to, or slandered\\\" Degenshein. Degenshein may have been upset about the character that was made fun of in the episode but the court stated that \\\"parody...is not the same thing as defamation.\\\" The court concluded that Degenshein had failed to state a cause of action for misappropriation because his professional goodwill was not uniquely associated with the \\\"Fat MacArthur\\\" character; nor was the \\\"Fat MacArthur\\\" character a single exclusive business. Degenshein v. Seinfeld, 4 A.D.3d 245, 771 N.Y.S.2d 445 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004).   2. Gamer's Edge v.

GE motioned for a preliminary injunction against a Florida gaming company, Cobra Golf, alleging that Cobra and its owner, Dan Cole, copied and used patented GE golf video game innovations in a way that exceeded the license agreement between the parties and constituted infringement.

Showing that GE's licensed patent rights constituted a protectable property interest and that the unauthorized use of GE's documents could cause irreparable harm to GE, the court granted GE's motion for a preliminary injunction. GE was ordered to give Cobra 30-days notice of the time at which GE would begin requiring Cobra's compliance with the license agreement.   Later, GE filed a motion for contempt of court against Cobra and Cole alleging that they violated the preliminary injunction by continuing to computer program and develop the infringing product. The court held that GE had met its burden to establish that the products were illegally infringing GE's license. The court found that GE had not met its burden to show irreparable harm because GE did not submit evidence of any lost sales or capacity. The court denied the motion for contempt against Cobra and Cole. Gamer's Edge, Inc. v. Cole, 99 F. Supp. 2d 1277 (M.D. Fla. 2000).   3. Guitar Center, Inc. v. Dynasty Guitars, Inc.  Guitar Center, Inc. (GC) and Jake Hunter's Guitar Emporium, Inc. (JGE) sold guitars and related merchandise. Dynasty Guitars, Inc. (DGI) started selling guitars at a variety of retail stores, including GC and JGE. GC and JGE filed suit for trademark and trade dress infringement, holding out false association, and unfair competition against DGI. GC and JGE alleged that DGI was infringing on their exclusive rights to the trade dress of GC and JGE guitar products.   After a trial, the court held that DGI infringed GC's and JGE's trade dress and awarded damages. Guitar Center, Inc. et al. v. Dynasty Guitars, Inc., 57 U.S.P.Q.2d 1357 (C.D.

There, the Legislature declares that the statutes impose upon all people working in certain trades related to homes, a warranty that the work will meet minimum standards for skill and safety. For example, the workmanship needs to be consistent with \\\"building standards and codes....\\\" Section 7191 states: \\\"A licensee who undertakes to furnish the services described in this chapter ... warrants that the licensee shall perform the services in a manner consistent with the standards of care, skill, and diligence normally provided by members of the licensee's profession actively practicing in California.... A licensee shall be responsible for a negligent act ... in the same manner as would be a person who was not licensed.\\\"    An implied warranty is an automatic promise created by law. It is different from an express warranty, which is a promise that the seller makes in words about the quality or functionality of the goods being sold. The seller may also make express warranties through brochures or ads. Implied warranties, however, are not written. They are not spoken. You cannot see them. They are based on what the law presumes is in a contract.    Under the law, there is an implied warranty of merchantability. This means that goods they are selling meet a minimum level of quality. They will work for the ordinary, particular purpose for which they are sold. For example, carrots must be firm and ripe enough for eating. But, any carrots vary in quality and size. Buyers also rely on an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. This means that if they buy goods for a particular purpose and tell this to the seller, the goods should be fit for the purpose. If an individual buys a car for racing and tells this to the seller, the car should be fit for that purpose. Implied warranties apply to both new and used goods.    Specifications are a detailed description of the design or materials used to make something. Plans are detailed diagrams, drawings or blueprints that show how something should be made or put together.    Breach of Implied Warranty of Correctness of Plans and Specifications means that the plans and specifications didn't meet the warranty.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The right to a jury instruction arises from the substantive law.

On appeal from the Court of Federal Claims, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Court of Federal Claims' dismissal of Merit Management's complaint for failing to exhaust dispute resolution procedures in the parties contract. The Court of Federal Claims determined that the parties dispute resolution procedures were mandatory because the contract expressly stated the procedures were to be followed, the procedures were not inconsistent with the contract other than with respect to cost determination, and the dispute resolution procedures did not conflict with the Contract Disputes Act - which requires certain procedures to be followed to preserve jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit thus held that a federal contractor is not entitled to recover on contract claims that were not first submitted for dispute resolution under contract procedures.

Complete the following questions to determine if the owner is entitled to recover money damages for the unaccepted work:       - Was the owner required to accept and pay for all of the work that does not conform to the contract? Answer: No. The owner was not required to accept and pay for all of the work that does not conform to the contract.     - Did the amount of unaccepted work or deficiency exceed a minor part of the entire contract? Answer: Yes.    - Would the unaccepted work substantially impair the value of the entire contract? Answer: Yes.       If you answered all three questions as indicated above, the owner is entitled to recover damages for the unaccepted work. With regard to the amount the owner is entitled to recover, there are two alternative methods of calculating damages. The first is based on the diminution in market value of the property as a result of the unaccepted work. The second is the cost to repair the unaccepted work. The owner is entitled to recover the lesser of the two amounts. Complete the following questions to determine the diminution in market value of the property as a result of the unaccepted work:       - Did the contract involve preexisting property of the owner?    - If question 1 was answered \\\"yes\\\": Was the value of the preexisting property, without improvements, to be the basis for measuring damages?     - If question 2 was answered \\\"yes\\\": Is it established that the value of the preexisting property, without improvements, is the basis for measuring damages? Answer: Not established.       Complete the following questions to determine the cost to cure or repair the unaccepted work:       - Did the owner cause an appraisal to be made of the property in order to determine the cost to cure or repair? If yes, the cost to cure or repair is the amount of that appraisal.    - If the owner did not cause an appraisal to be made or the amount of the appraisal is not in evidence: If repair is reasonably possible, could it be done in such manner that it would not reduce the value of the property more than the cost of such repair?    - If question 2 was answered \\\"yes\\\": Can repair be done at a reasonable cost?    - If repair can be done at a reasonable cost: Will the reduction in value of the property, taking into account such repair, be greater than the cost of such repair?    - If the reduction in value of the property, taking into account such repair, is not greater than the cost of such repair: Is the cost of a substitute necessary to replace unaccepted work reasonably ascertainable?     - If the cost of a substitute is reasonably ascertainable: Is the cost to acquire and install a reasonably suitable substitute, as compared to the unaccepted work, the cost of such a substitute?    - If the cost of a substitute is not reasonably ascertainable or the cost of a substitute is not the cost to acquire and install a reasonably suitable substitute: Is the cost of replacement of the unaccepted work with similar work, as compared to the unaccepted work, the cost of such replacement?       - If question 1 was answered \\\"no\\\", question 6 was answered \\\"no\\\", question 7 was answered \\\"no\\\", and question 9(a) was answered \\\"no\\\": Is the cost of the repair the amount of that injury?

However, proof of damages need not be perfect, and a plaintiff may recover if a preponderance of the evidence supports the damages sought. Strict accounting is not required. In any case, the burden is on the contractor to prove its damages.   The contractor may recover damages for a breach of a construction contract in several different ways. If the breach involved the owner's failure to pay contract price, the contractor may recover under a theory of quantum meruit, that is, the reasonable value of the services actually and knowingly performed. Alternatively, the contractor may recover on a theory of unjust enrichment, that is, there is no contract but the owner would be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to keep the benefit of the contractor's work without paying for it. In addition, the contractor may recover the contract price under a theory of breach of contract, even if the work was not completed (subject to certain exceptions).   In order to recover under the contract, the contractor must establish it substantially performed the contract. The contractor may recover even if it did not perform all of the contract requirements, but in that event, the owner may offset from the contract price the cost to complete the contract. Courts will generally not require precise performance if the contractor substantially performed the contract. Alteration contracts, however, are usually interpreted so as to require strict performance.   In addition to the contract price, contractors may recover damages for extra work or changes ordered by the owner, as well as for time extensions or other modifications of the contract. These are essentially claims for \\\"extras,\\\" and the contractor must comply with the procedural and formal requirements of the contract (such as providing a written request for the extra, a formal change order signed by the owner, specification of the amount and basis of the change, and similar requirements). Additional requirements may be  of extras. For example, when extras are work of a type specifically excluded from the contract, the contractor may recover even if it does not follow the contract's procedure for changes. When extras are rejections of part of the work as not conforming to contract requirements, the contractor may also recover them without compliance with the contract's change procedure.   The cost of extras to the contractor may be based on the contract schedule of values, the contractor's price list or other similar document, or on the actual cost of performance. When the time to complete the contract has been exceeded, the contractor is also entitled to costs which have increased because of the delay. When the contract has been suspended and restarted, the contractor is entitled to the increased costs due to the suspension and on restarting plus any lost profits on the portion of the work laid off during the suspension. When the amount claimed includes amounts for indirect costs, \\\"home office\\\" expenses or the cost of performance of unauthorized work, the owner is entitled to offsets for value received, for the claim and for amounts not supported by documentary evidence.

United States v. Thornhill Inv., 212 F.3d 530, 538 (10th Cir. 2000). Contractor argues that the court erred in instructing the jury to find the amount of damages Contractor had proven under quantum meruit as compensation for the work Contractor performed on the Belcourt project, more specifically, that the instructions and verdict forms did not account for the \\\"benefit\\\" requirement of quantum meruit and did not explicitly state that Tribal Enterprise must have been enriched in order for Contractor to be entitled to damages in the amount it proved.

With respect to the amount of damages, the instructions informed the jury that it could award $262,996.14 only if its answer to the preceding question was \\\"yes,\\\" a reference to the question that asked the jury to determine whether Contractor had proven that Tribal Enterprise had accepted some of the benefits of the work under the contract.

Acceleration increases the contractor's costs, including the cost of additonal labor, over time premium, extra job supervision, overtime, and other costs. The contractor may recover for these damages if the contract includes a \\\"no damages for delay clause\\\" and if factors beyond the owner's control also caused delays to the contract.

App. Ohio, 10th Dist., 2/8/12) On a fixed price construction contract with the State of Ohio, the contract completion time was extended three times. The contractor argued that additional extensions were warranted for various reasons, some related to delays allegedly caused by the state, some unrelated. The Court of Appeals noted that the record showed that, at various times, the state acted as  the project manager and was responsible for keeping the project on schedule, maintaining a log of working days, and verifying delays. The court noted that it is the role of the engineers and not the courts to determine the number of working days and the date for project completion and that those determinations are binding so long as the engineers complied with the law and did not act arbitrarily or unreasonably. The court found that the state engineers had not acted arbitrarily in finding four contract extensions instead of some other number. The court noted that at least one was apparently in response to a delay caused by the state as owner. Because the project was under a fixed price contract, the court found that the delay did not entitle the contractor to additional compensation. SiteWork Contracting Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Dist., No. 2010AP1759 (Wis. Ct. of Appeals, 7th Dist., 3/28/12) The contractor on a construction project sued for delay damages. The contract had a schedule with a final completion date and a liquidated damage clause. Alterations to the work included a time extension of 18 days for completion of the project. The circuit court dismissed the contractor's claims for delay damages. The court of appeals affirmed, finding that because the contract had a liquidated damages provision, which also required substantial completion by the completion date, the contract precluded recovery for delay damages except under certain circumstances which did not apply here. The court further noted that, because the contract had a liquidated damages clause and there was an agreed-upon extension of the work, the contractor was entitled to no additional compensation for delays except damages it could recover for increased costs of performing the contract. The court found that the contractor had not presented evidence of the latter. STI Construction, Inc. v. City of Orem, No. 20090318-CA (Utah Court of Appeals, 10/24/11) A contractor on a city created delay project won summary judgment on its claim for $1,021,320 in additional costs. The contract had a fixed price for performing the work and a liquidated damages provision. The contract said that it was the owner's responsibility to provide access to the work site by specified times, and that the contract time would be adjusted for delays caused by the owner. The project completion date was delayed more than 15 months. The contractor needed to employ more people and pay increased wages due to the extended work schedule. The court noted that, absent a provision for increased labor costs, a contractor does not necessarily bear the risk of owner caused delays. The court also noted that the owner did not contest that the additional costs were reasonable and were related to the extended schedule. The court affirmed an award to the contractor for the extra costs. American Ins. Co. v. Fox Quarry Co., 508 N.W.2d 287 (Neb. 1993) The court found that a contractor was entitled to damages for the increased costs it incurred to perform a contract because of a 35-day delay, an owner-caused acceleration of the contract schedule and a related increase in the contract quantities. The court noted that part of the damages were indirect costs consisting of additional supervision, engineering, and other overhead attributable to the additional work that increased the capacity of the contractor's operations.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}
