This is, sort of, what quantum computers are, but with bits instead of toast.     Regular, or classical, computers are built with one-bit things that are either turned off or on. We call the turned off state 0 and the turned on state 1. Certain combinations of 0's and 1's can mean different things. For example 1011 might be the instruction to send a bit of information to your printer, or it could represent a letter in the alphabet, or it could be a number like 15. Now, 1011 is made of four bits, which means that each of the bits has to be either off or on.     Quantum computers are made of quantum bits, or qubits. A qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This is called superposition. If it were just a matter of being 0 and 1 at the same time, that wouldn't be very useful, but qubits are able to interact with each other through a process called entanglement. Entanglement means that qubits are linked together so that when one changes, another changes in response.     Because of this, a quantum computer with two qubits could be 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, or both 1 and 0. whereas a classical computer can only be 1 and 0 or 0 and 1. A quantum computer with three qubits could have any combination of 1 and 0 for the three bits (that's eight combinations), but if they weren't entangled, you would have to prepare for each situation separately. With classical computer you would have to prepare for each possibility. The number of combinations you have to prepare for grows exponentially, which means that the growth rate gets faster as the numbers get bigger. So, for qubits, if you added 4 more bits (for a total of 7) you would have to prepare for 2.5 times as many combinations as before. Add in 10 more (17 total) and you would have to prepare for more than 10,000 times as many combinations.

COMPUTING VECTOR: The basic unit of quantum computation is a quantum bit or \\\"qubit\\\", which defines a two-dimensional quantum system. Quantum gates manipulate an input of qubits into a different output of qubits, in a reversible fashion. The quantum circuit is then measured to obtain a result. The power of quantum computing comes from the possibility of being in many different states at one time (superposition). If we have one quantum bit, it can be in a superposition of two different states (for instance |0> and |1>). If we have two bits, they can be in a superposition of four different states (|00>, |01>, |10>, |11>), and three bits eight states and so on.    The gates most commonly used in quantum computing come from the DiVincenzo/Ryan (DVR) gate library. A recent development is a class of gates called \\\"XYX\\\" which has properties that may decrease the error rate. There is also a quantum compiler which translates calculations into quantum computer steps.     ALGORITHMS OVER CLASSICAL ONES: Shor's quantum factoring algorithm is a quantum algorithm that factors integers in polynomial time, which would break the widely-used RSA public key cryptography. Another famous example is Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm can speed up computations for unstructured search problems by doing O(\\\\sqrt{N}) operations instead of O(N) operations.     Noisy quantum computers are unlikely to be able to simulate ideal quantum gates to arbitrarily small error. If noisy quantum computers can efficiently simulate ideal quantum circuits to within fixed error, it would mean quantum computers can tolerate errors without error correction, which most researchers consider unlikely.     In quantum complexity theory, BQP is the class of problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances (i.e., with a probability of at least 2/3 of obtaining the right answer).    HISTORY: The origins of quantum computing includes a 1980 speech by Paul Benioff describing a quantum mechanical Turing machine. In 1981, Richard Feynman gave a lecture about simulating physics on a computer. He said that there would be major advantages to using quantum systems for computation instead of traditional computing, but did not show how to do a quantum computation. David Deutsch, in 1985, gave a description of a quantum Turing machine. In 1989, Deutsch, Toffoli, and Lloyd showed that a universal quantum computer can approximate the dynamics of any other quantum system.     TECHNOLOGY: The first demonstration of Grover's algorithm was shown in 1998 in NMR. The first demonstration of Shor's algorithm was also in NMR. The most popular technology used to date for demonstrating quantum algorithms is NMR, for which small computers have been built with up to about 7 qubits. Potential advantages of NMR include no need for cooling and flexible control. Transmon qubits are the qubit of the state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors. Since 2011 Google has employed D-Wave's processors for various proof-of-concept quantum applications. In 2019 JB Straubel, co-founder and former CTO of Tesla, bought a stake in D-Wave. Agarwal says the investment signaled a shift in how quantum computing is perceived, especially for companies interested in exploring its potential applications.

Summary of Part 1: The story is set in the nation of Airstrip One, formerly Great Britain. Winston Smith is a member of the Outer Party, and his job is to rewrite history to conform to the Party's propaganda. Although the Party claims to have conquered the outside world, at the beginning of the story there is an air of unrest. The novel begins with Winston returning home to his dilapidated flat. On the wall of every room is the poster of \\\"Big Brother,\\\" the Party's leader, with the caption \\\"Big Brother Is Watching You.\\\" Part 2: Smith begins a secret love affair with a young woman, Julia, who also works in the Ministry of Truth. They share a disdain for the Party and its leader, Big Brother. Just being able to express these sentiments aloud to each other gives them great pleasure. The couple eventually rents a room above a storefront as their headquarters. They still risk the wrath of the thought police by reading materials and watching films that are not approved by the Party. Part 3: Smith and Julia are caught by the Thought Police, taken to the Ministry of Love, and subjected to a laundry list of physical and emotional tortures. Big Brother's goal is to have complete loyalty, love, and obedience from the citizens of Oceania, even if it requires altering their memories. After Smith makes a full confession, the cruelty subsides, and he is taken to the Chestnut Tree Caf\u00e9, where dissidents gather to drink gin and listen to music played on a tinny piano. While in the cafe, Smith ends his story of rebellion, and the novel concludes.

The citizens have no rights. They live in constant fear that they will say or do something wrong. They are continually watched by cameras and microphones and have no privacy.

This government has a rigid social structure much like old-fashioned England's. There are the elite Inner-Party members and the more numerous Outer Party members. Then there is everyone else, known as the proles. Because the government fears the Outer Party and the proles more than it fears themselves, it oppresses these groups in terrible ways, while the Inner Party lives in relative luxury.

As the book opens, the world is divided into three parts, each controlled by a different totalitarian government that possesses atomic weapons. The United States, Oceania, and East Asia jostle each other and are constantly at war. The countries' governments control every aspect of public and private life wherever they rule, and their powers are unlimited. Although they're called different names, each government is basically the same: a dictatorship.  Winston Smith lives in London, which is in Oceania. He works at the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history so it fits the needs of the party. But Winston secretly hates the party and dreams of rebellion. He starts writing a diary and develops a relationship with another party member, Julia. However, they are arrested and Winston finds that there is no escape from the party.  Orwell's story is about government control and the power of the state. It is also about loss of identity. In 1984, people have no rights and private life is a thing of the past. Later, when Orwell describes the torture of Winston, he addresses what the true human heart is in the reality of oppression.

Design can also refer to the structure of something that can be seen, like a web site or a garment.    - Learn the principles of design: Balance, repetition, contrast, proportion, and white space.    - Get proficient with design software: Most graphic designs are done with computer software. Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are the two most popular programs. There are also others like Corel Draw, Xara, and Quark that are good too.    - Study graphic design theory: Learn about color, points, lines, and planes. Study how these elements of design can be combined to make pleasing artwork.    - Take a formal course: Although many successful graphic designers never studied design, taking a course can be helpful. Do a Google or Yahoo! search for \\\"graphic design courses.\\\"    - Practice your skills: Put together your own logo or letterhead. Create a flyer that catches your eye. Design your own web site from scratch, instead of using a template.    - Find a mentor: Ask an experienced designer in your area if you can meet with her to discuss your designs.

To become a \\\"real\\\" graphic designer, however, you typically need to have both some natural artistic ability and some formal training. Graphic design is a creative career, so the first step to learning the craft is understanding the building blocks of drawing. Babies draw, but they don't know that they're drawing. To have the ability to understand the building blocks of drawing is to have the ability to draw anything.     Today, graphic design is a digital art. Raster vs. vector; resolution vs. pixels. These are things you should learn about digital art if you don't know them already. There are three things you can learn about graphic design that will help you the most. Designs start today, more than ever, with typography. Whether you are creating logos or brochures or ads or packaging, the font you use is an integral part of your design, often more important than your image work. Every graphic design should be able to be looked at in black and white and make sense. No objections to color, but what happens when your design is \\\"read\\\" in grayscale? Color theory is important to graphic design because you need to learn about complimentary colors, warm vs. cool colors, contrast, moods created by colors, color harmonies, etc. to use color effectively.    If you enter graphic design soon, you will be a digital designer. Modern digital art is a lot about photo-realism, and there are a lot of things you can learn (many of which are in the programs themselves - tutorials and such) to help you gain skills that range from simulating a paintbrush to making your own textures to using vector paths, the pen tool, and custom brushes.    A school, a class, online tutorials, or khanacademy.org Art History or Art Fundamentals are ways to learn about art appreciation.

Compliment people, call them by name, ask about them, listen well, laugh, and be interested. Do the things you would want someone to do for you.

Their suggestions range from turning down your heating and air conditioning, to using water efficiently to carpooling to switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs.     - You can weigh the options about your diet. A vegetarian diet generates an average of 0.8 tons of carbon. A diet with a moderate amount of meat and dairy generates 1.5 tons, while most people's current diets are generating 1.8 tons of carbon or more.    - You can weigh the options about your travel. Driving a high mileage car instead of a medium mileage car, for a family of 4, will change the carbon footprint of a 2,000 mile automobile trip from 0.25 to 0.48 tons of carbon, but a round trip airplane flight from New York to Miami emits about 0.50 tons of carbon per person.    - You can help shape the future.

When you adopt, you give one of these animals a second chance.    Should I consider adopting a pet from an animal shelter? There are always many wonderful animals available from animal shelters. Because of numbers and disease, you have the best chance of getting puppies and kittens from responsible breeders. However, if you are looking for an adult or senior animal, a shelter is the place to go. And if you want a kitten or puppy, you can sometimes find one in a shelter as well.    It is a good idea to adopt a spayed or neutered animal. Many shelters and rescues sterilize animals before adoption. However, if you get an animal that is not sterilized, do it as soon as possible. This will keep your pet healthier than if you wait until it is older.    It is important to go to a shelter, rescue group, or foster home to meet the animal before adoption. Many shelters evaluate and list animals' personalities to help potential adopters find a good match.    Dogs that have been in a shelter or multiple homes need a lot of patience and understanding. Some adjust readily to new homes. However, some are nervous and mistrusting. Provide modest accommodations for them - another room - until they get used to their new home. They need to know you will be patient and kind to them and will not make them get used to a large household, several people, and noisy children overnight. Some animals need more time than others.    All shelter animals supposed to have current vaccinations. Ask for their medical records or if vaccinations were given at the shelter, ask if the shelter veterinarian can give permission to contact him or her.    How do I find adoptable pets? To find adoptable pets in your area or a larger area, try an adoption database such as Petfinder, the Web's largest database of adoptable pets. It allows you to search by location, species, and breed.    If you would like a purebred, you may also want to check breed rescue groups for that breed. Many are members of the National Federation of Dog Clubs and the American Federation of Cat Clubs. Their Web site links to breed rescue groups.    When should I adopt a pet? There is no better time than now to adopt from a shelter. Each year, 6 to 8 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters, and at least half of these animals are euthanized.

Some dietary supplements may appear to help because they contain prescription drug ingredients. The FDA has identified numerous sexual enhancement dietary supplements that contain unapproved ingredients that are undisclosed on the product label. These products can be dangerous because they may contain ingredients that interact with other drugs, especially nitrates, or medications for blood pressure, and they may leave you with dangerously low blood pressure. They can also pose health risks for those with heart conditions or those who take cholesterol reducing, blood thinning, anti-depressant or other drugs.

Is there an artist hiding inside you, looking for a way to say something? Or are you just looking for a fresh approach to life? To be creative, you have to come up with something new. At the least, it has to be new to you. Nothing about being creative says that it has to be new to the world - or even new to your family or your co-workers.    But creativity does require a new connection between thoughts, ideas or feelings. To create a connection that hasn't been noticed before, you need a library of ideas to choose from - a lot of knowledge, facts, experiences, or thoughts. When you know a lot, you have more to choose from and your combinations can be more complex and nuanced. So, if you want to stimulate your creativity, stimulating your mind is a good place to start. Anything that interests you - an interesting conversation, an engaging activity, or a fascinating puzzle - will stimulate your mental faculties. Writing or drawing about challenges or previous experiences also gets the part of your mind that handles connections and combinations into gear. Learning and exploring, nurturing your relationships, and expressing your feelings are other ways to make connections and feed the creative part of the mind.    Puzzles involving concepts and connections, such as crossword puzzles, juggle names and concepts and strengthen mental links. Carl Jung-type puzzles combine consciousness and the unconscious and can lead to deep insights.    To nurture and develop your ideas, you need the time and space to reflect. Choose a comfortable chair in a quiet, pleasant place. Get some colorful drawing paper and pencils, or gathering materials for a collage, or just imagine. All of those will help you concentrate. Once you have your ideas, you'll need to work on them, alone or with a group, to shape and express them.

Follow these steps to create a budget that works for you. 1. Determine how much money you receive each month In order to accurately prepare a budget, you first need to know exactly how much money you have each month. Use your net income, that is the money you actually have in hand and can spend, instead of your gross income, which is your income minus taxes. Take your net income from your job and add any extra income you receive such as deposits from the sale of goods or services, interest and dividends from investments, and income from gifts, alimony, lottery prizes and other sources. 2. Write down everything you spend money on for at least a week Keeping a spending diary will tell you where your money goes. If the purchases are many and small, you may not even remember them. If the purchases are large, you may not be able to guess the exact amount. To make a spending diary, get some paper and pen and for the next week write down everyday all your expenses. Write down the purchase and its cost. 3. Add your expenses together and see how much you spend each month Add the total expenses and compare it to your monthly income. If you spend more than you bring in, that is a problem. But it also means that a budget could help you. 4. Separate your needs from your wants You need food, shelter and clothing. But every time you buy a coffee, go out to eat for lunch or order in pizza you are buying a want. Instead of a coffee maker for your home, you buy the \\\"Barista Collection\\\". Make it a goal to cut down on the maximum number of wants you can afford and still be happy. 5. Make a budget page for each type of expense It is easiest to use a computer program, but you can also use paper. A budget has three parts: income (money you make or receive), fixed expenses and variable expenses. Your income is how much money you have. Fixed expenses cannot be changed: your rent or house payments, car payments and insurance. The amount of your variable expenses such as utilities, food, clothing and entertainment varies from month to month. 6. Decide how much you want to budget for each budget type Sum up the amounts you budget for each of your expense types. This should not be more than your monthly income. (If it is, cut back on some categories or find ways to increase your income.) To make sure you stick to your budget, you can withdraw money as cash and place them in envelopes for each category. When the money is gone it means you have no more money for that category. 7. Compare your expenses to your budget Every once and a while, check to see whether you are spending what you budgeted for.

Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The players take turns moving one piece at a time, with White moving first. There are also two special moves in chess: castling and en passant. Castling is where a rook and the king are moved during the same turn. En passant is a special pawn capture that can only occur when one player moves their pawn two squares forward from its starting position, and an enemy pawn could have captured it \\\"en passant\\\" if it had moved only one square forward. In addition, when a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it is promoted and must be exchanged for a queen, rook, bishop or knight of the same color. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. This happens when the king is under immediate attack and there is no way for it to escape. If a player's king is threatened with capture, the king is said to be in check. If the player does not make a move that eliminates the threat, the king will be in checkmate and the game will be over.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Learn Openings: While it's important not to rely too heavily on memorization, having a basic understanding of some chess openings can help. Focus on understanding the ideas and goals behind the openings rather than memorizing specific moves.    4. Practice Regularly: Play games consistently. Start with longer time controls before moving to blitz or bullet chess. Analyze your games afterwards to learn from your mistakes.    5. Watch Chess Videos or Read Books: Many strong players share their knowledge online. Watching their explanations can be very beneficial. Reading classical chess books can also provide a deep insight into the game.    6. Analyze Your Games: After each game, especially losses, analyze what happened. Use a chess engine to check the analysis and understand your mistakes.    7. Join a Chess Club: Playing against and interacting with different players can expose you to various styles.

Are they there because they are interested in the topic, or is it part of their job?    - Be prepared - To get started, write an outline. Review it and add information and supporting evidence. When you feel comfortable, write your speech. Make note cards to use while speaking.

Over time you will feel less tense.    - Focus on the message - Try to focus on the message you are trying to get across rather than on yourself or your fear.    - Visualize the experience - When you visualize, you imagine yourself speaking and succeeding. Visualizing success can increase your confidence and reduce your fear.    - Take a \\\"public speaking\\\" class - Look for classes through your local college or community group.    - View speaking as a conversation - Knowing that a speaker is simply relating a message to an audience within earshot can help reduce anxiety.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Speaking in public can cause anxiety in anyone.

You may be able to borrow a guitar for a few months. By then, you'll know what kind of student you are, and you'll have a better idea whether you really want to commit to lessons.    If you decide to take lessons, it's important to understand that it takes determination and consistent practice.

It is a naturally leavened bread product that uses a building up of wild yeasts and good bacteria called starter. The green/yellow bad bacteria die as the starter matures and is fed and the good (white) bacteria and yeast live on. This process is called fermentation.    The result of fermentation is a sour and yeasty smelling bubbly goo that acts as the leavener for the dough. It also acts as a preservative and makes the bread easier to digest.

Although it is possible to make a batch in a week or two, some people take months to cultivate their leavens (see below). One general piece of advice: you will be very frustrated. Expect to lose several batches of bread before you get really good at it. Back some up in the freezer in case you want to eat them later - the taste improves with time.     The main chemical ingredients in leavening are yeasts and bacteria. Specifically, Saccharomyces (or related yeasts) and Lactobacillus bacteria. You can purchase dried versions of these ingredients at a pharmaceutical, health food, or herb store but for sourdough they must be culturing together. A flour and water mixture captures wild yeasts and bacteria from the environment. The yeasts consume the carbohydrates and release carbon dioxide that makes bubbles and leavens. The bacteria release acids which cause particular flavors. If dried yeast is added to the mixture to active it, the only culture is the added yeast, not wild yeast.    The necessary household tools to make sourdough are two big bowls and a dough scraper. You also need some storage containers, such as pint jars, plastic tubs, or Tupperware containers. (While the dough and pancakes can be turned out of the bowls, the dough will stick to container sides.)   For an improved taste and texture, use a really good flour.

Most commercial bakeries use a dried yeast culture to make regular breads, but its chemical reaction is quick, so the effects and tastes die off fast (which is why store-bought breads generally only last for a few days or less.) The wild yeast culture causes a fermentation process, which is both slower and different. Wild yeast breads actually just get better with age - they don't become stale - and sourdough breads tend to have more natural vitamins and nutrients.

A sourdough starter is a mixture of flour and water where the natural wild (and good!) yeasts in the air can grow. It is the sourdough start that gives sourdough bread its special flavor and helps your bread dough rise.     The components for a starter are simple: flour and water! You don't need to add yeast because yeast is floating in the air (and on the flour), and it will be attracted to the starter, which it will use as food. It is important that when you mix the starter, you use clean unchlorinated tap water or filtered water. If you have chlorinated tap water, the chlorine will kill the yeast, however if you boil your tap water and let it cool before using, the chlorine is removed.     To make the starter, mix 1/4 cup of unbleached flour and 1/8 cup of water. Cover the bowl with a paper towel, and let it set on your counter at room temperature. Once a day, feed your starter by stirring it and adding an equal amount of unbleached flour and water. For example if your starter is 1 cup, you'll add 1/2 cup flour, and 1/2 cup water, (1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup water if its only half a cup, etc).    You will know your starter is ready when it is bubbly, has risen to twice its original size, and has a nice sour smell. This usually takes about a week. If the starter separates into layers, just mix it together and give it another feeding. If you see discoloration or fuzzy spots, it is mold and you should start again.

Basic Steps in Baking Sourdough       - Nourish the starter    - Prepare the sponge    - Mix the dough     - Bake the bread       Sourdough bread can be tricky to prepare because the yeasts and bacteria in the starter are very sensitive to changes in temperature, humidity, baking times, and other variables. It is best to begin by following a recipe very closely. After a few batches, you should be able to make adjustments and experiment with other recipes.     To help find out what is going wrong, it is important to know what a \\\"good dough\\\" looks like. Here are some suggestions to help you troubleshoot. The descriptions given here are for doughs prepared with the recipes in this section. A different recipe will have a different consistency.     \\\"Good\\\" dough should feel springy and smooth and have no dry flour at the bottom of the bowl. After the first kneading, it will be shaggy. Kneed it for about 5 minutes to develop the gluten. The gluten will trap the gas which is being produced by the yeast and bacteria.     The dough should double in volume during the first fermenting or rising. When it is ready, it will no longer feel springy. \\\"Poke\\\" the dough and if the dough does not bounce back quite so quickly it has almost doubled in size. If it doesn't bounce back at all, it has tripled in size and is ready to use or for you to have the next step. Check the dough in about 30 minutes for the first rising and about 15 minutes for the 2nd rising. If the dough has not risen enough, check again later.     If you are checking the dough more than 30 minutes after you began to let it rise, before you \\\"poke\\\" it, gently deflate it. When you are ready to shape it, the dough will be \\\"resting\\\" and you can shape it in about 10 minutes.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

There are free apps like iTalk for iPhone, Audio Memos, or Simply Audio Recorder.      - Computer podcast: If you want to use your computer as a recorder, try out Audacity - it's free! If you are on a Mac, it is included with GarageBand or use Quicktime player. A USB microphone is recommended.        - Phone/Skype podcast: If you want to talk to someone far away over the phone or over Skype, look into recording software like ecamm.com.      - Two or more people podcast: If you have 2 or more people in the same room, you need at least two microphones and a mixer. An Audio-Technica ATR2100 USB microphone and an that will connect with your Mac or PC.      - Find a recording space - Pick a quiet room with little or no echo. Carpet helps keep echo to a minimum. You can add blankets to bare walls in the recording area for best results.     - Come up with a show idea and format - Take a look at all of the podcasts out there. What kind of shows do you listen to? Do you want music? Guests? Are there certain subjects you care about? Figure out what you want your show to be.     - Create the content - Write an outline or script and then record your show, edit it, and export it as an audio file.    - Get hosting - Come up with a name for your podcast and get a domain name. Then find a web host to put your files on. You will need to figure out where you affiliates to generously share our knowledge about podcasting with you.

Whatever you choose, there are some basics you'll need: a computer to produce and publish your podcast, a microphone, and might want to consider some sort of audio editing software.     - Record. Find a quiet room and the right kind of microphone. The finished recording should be a high quality audio file, such as a WAV, for easy playback by your listeners.     - Edit. It's a good idea to edit your recording to make sure you have sound, no long dead time, no unexpected interruptions, and no long pauses, and that it is not too long.     - Publish. To make it easier for your listeners, either create a page on your website where the podcasts can be downloaded, or upload the file to a server that publishes podcasts. Start the file name with \\\"podcast-\\\" so it's recognizable.     - Start an RSS feed. Provide an RSS feed for your podcast so that people can subscribe to it and keep up with new episodes as you publish them. There are many popular blogging tools that can be used to create RSS feeds.

Consider the amount of light in the area you choose for your garden before deciding what to plant.  How much soil do you need? For small or beginner gardens, you don't need a lot of room. One medium tomato plant can easily fill a 10 square foot area. If you are just starting, try to do a \\\"practice\\\" garden. Plant only the amount of vegetables that your family can eat. You do not want to grow so much that your vegetables go to waste. You can grow in the ground or even in containers.  How do I know when the vegetables are ready? Fruits, vegetables and herbs are ready to harvest when they have reached their correct size and color (for fruits and vegetables), or the flavor is sharp or intense enough to use (herbs).  How much work is a garden? There's weeding, watering, harvesting and eventually storing or canning. Time to care for your garden will depend on the age and number of plants, soil conditions, and the weather.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Beginning a vegetable garden can be a fun and rewarding project.

The type of vegetables you grow will depend on the climate where you live, the time of the year, and your personal preferences. Think about what vegetables you eat most often.

Vegetables that are frequently grown in home gardens include a wide variety of beans; beets; broccoli; carrots; corn; cucumbers; lettuce and other salad greens; onions; peas; peppers; potatoes; spinach; squash; sweet corn; tomatoes; and zucchini.    Where should I plant my garden? Wherever you decide to plant your garden, keep in mind that most vegetables need a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight each day. They also do better with extra water during dry spells, so you'll want to water the plants during the summer or have a way to irrigate the garden.     What supplies do I need? You will need trowels and other hand and gardening tools, and containers of compost and/or manure to add nutrients to your soil (or you can buy ready-mixed planting soil). You will also need seeds for the plants you want to grow. You might want to start some of them indoors. If so, you will need pots, trays and a good, natural soil for starting your plants.    Before you buy, check with your neighbors, garden center or cooperative extension service to find out what pests and diseases might be common in your neighborhood so that you can plan what to plant. Smart planning means your vegetables will grow strong and healthy.     How do I plant my garden? Planting guidelines vary according to the vegetable. Your seed packets will explain how deep and how far apart to plant your seeds. You can find additional information in gardening books and online.    Should I use organic practices in my garden?

Give your body time to adapt to new exercises such as running and new diets by introducing them one by one.    - Train with a marathon in mind. A long training run will prepare your legs and mind for the marathon.    - Don't over-train. If you know that down the road you're going to be running long distances, laying down a solid training foundation can slow the rate of injury in your training.    - Take the time for recovery runs. In between your long training runs, recovery runs will bring your legs back to life. They boost your fitness and help you avoid injury.    - Taper. Your taper allows your body to recover and build up energy and strength for the big day. Once you've trained well, enjoy your taper!    - Switch up your snacks. Try different foods and drinks on your training runs to find out which ones agree with you.    - Do a practice run. Practice the marathon route.    - Stick with your training schedule. Practicing your ideal race day pace during training can help you with your pacing on race day.    - Use sunscreen. A sunburn can leave you in pain and make your recovery period longer. Protect your skin with a broad spectrum, water resistant (sweatproof) sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.    - Stick to tested running shoes. Wear tested running shoes on race day. Don't try out new ones that you haven't broken in.     - Check your neighborhood. Know the busy traffic areas of your neighborhood and avoid them.    - Practice safety.

The marathoner Deena Kastor used walking breaks throughout the 2004 Olympics women's marathon to set a new American women's record.    For someone training for their first marathon, walking breaks might be a good idea because it's quicker to train a walk-run pace to the marathon distance than it is to train to run a marathon pace.

Every training plan has four main types of runs:       - Easy runs    - Long runs    - Midweek medium-long runs    - Speed workouts       Easy runs: These should make up the majority of your runs. They are important because they help build your base mileage to get your muscles, bones, and tendons used to running.     Long runs: These runs are longer than your normal routine, helping you get used to the distance. Long runs also help you lose weight, build strong bones and joints, improve your cardiovascular system and release stress.     Midweek medium-long runs: These runs become really important when your long run is more than 10 miles. This run helps you keep up with your training so you don't start to lose fitness after you've hit the 10-mile point.     Speed workouts: These faster runs help increase VO2 max, which is the most reliable measurement of cardiovascular fitness. Good speed workouts help build your endurance and make your goal marathon pace feel easier.

Most include some combination of the following:       - Rest     - Short runs     - Heart-rate or speed training     - Long runs        What follows is a typical beginner's marathon training schedule that shows three runs a week, each with a different purpose. It's based on an adaptation of the one used by Hal Higdon.       RUN 1: SPEED or HEART-RATE TRAINING     Purpose: To strengthen your heart and increase your pace. This is usually the shortest run of the week.     - Warm up by walking briskly for 5 to 10 minutes. Then stretch gently, holding each stretch for 10 to 15 seconds.     - Start jogging. If you're new to exercise, alternate walking and jogging, avoiding hills as you do so. Concentrate on using good running form.     - If using a heart rate monitor, once your heart rate reaches about 70% of your maximum, continue exercising at that level for 15 to 30 minutes. (Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age.)     - If not using a heart rate monitor, set a pace that you can maintain steadily without having to stop or slow down. Jog for 15 to 30 minutes.     - Cool down by walking briskly for 5 to 10 minutes. Then stretch as you did in step 1.        RUN 2: SHORT RUN     Purpose: To continue building your heart's strength at a more relaxed pace. This is usually a short run up to one hour in length.     Follow RUN 1, but keep your heart rate well under 70% of its maximum, and/or set a slower, steady pace. You should be able to comfortably carry on a conversation while running.        RUN 3: LONG RUN     Purpose: To build endurance. Start with a pace that feels relaxed and set a stopwatch. Your goal is to be able to run a minimum of 30 minutes continuously by the end of your training. Base the distance of your first one-hour run on how far you think you could run in that time. Each week, add as much distance as you feel comfortable with.     Follow the guidelines below:     - If using heart rate training, keep your heart rate under 60% of its maximum throughout the run.     - If not using a heart rate monitor, set a very gentle pace for the entire run, one that makes you feel like you are \\\"just exercising.\\\"     - Dress and bring liquids with you as if you might be running for 2 to 3 hours.     - Listen to your body. Slow down if you feel tired. And stop if you feel sick or sharp pain.        REST & RECOVERY     Time off from running is very important to prevent you from overdoing it. At least one day a week, take a rest day. Also give your legs a chance to recover by alternating running days with \\\"cross-training\\\" types of activities you enjoy. Good choices include bicycling, swimming, walking, stair climbing, dancing, or racquet sports.     If you feel tired, take it easy. It's better to miss a day or two than to get injured or sick.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"If you want to train for a marathon, the first thing you need to do is decide what your goal is. Are you hoping to complete the marathon without walking or are you trying to run the whole thing, or are you trying to finish within a particular time? If you want to finish the whole thing running in less than 4 hours, for example, this changes the training you'll want to do.    There are a few principles that hold true no matter what your goal is. You need to build up your mileage slowly (no more than a 10% increase week to week), incorporate rest days, and plan recovery time after a particularly hard week or a race. You should include 20-35 mile weeks even during your 'down' weeks and the long run should be no less than 35% of your total weekly mileage.     Once you know what your overall goal is, you can decide how many times you want to run in a given week and how much mileage you should build to. For example, if you want to be able to run 3 times during the week (not including a \\\"long\\\" run on the weekend), your total weekly mileage may only be 5 miles, then 7, then 10, etc. If you want to run 5 times a week, your schedule would be different and you'd likely include some shorter runs during the week, a \\\"mid distance\\\" run on the weekend and a \\\"long\\\" run.    Below are three example schedules showing three different approaches - running 2, 3 or 5 times a week - each with a different number of weeks to build up. Each schedule shows the weekday runs in blue and the weekend run in red.

Good luck, and never give up! Here are some tips to get you started on your novel: Choose a story idea. Almost any story idea can make a good novel, but it's important that you choose one that will keep your interest for months or years down the line, since that's how long it may take you to write the novel. If you want to write what you know, a novel setting that you know well can help you keep your story straight and can provide a moral or political atmosphere for the story. In contrast, if you want to write what you'd like to know, your novel may help you in making plans for your future. Either way, the next step is to decide the genre of your novel and to decide who your audience will be. Plan the story to help you organize the story before you start to write. General brainstorming can start with a story summit, where you write everything you know, think, or feel about the story idea. From this, you can create a concept map, and choose which story you want to work on. Next, list the key scenes and create an ordinality story matrix. Then, write scene skeletons and white space the outline into a draft. Choose a point of view. Narratives can be told in a variety of points of view. Choose the one that is best for your story. Make sure to stick to the point of view you have chosen. Begin writing the story. Revised and edit the draft if you can. Check your work for \\\"small issues\\\" (e.g., spelling and grammar), plot issues (e.g., plot holes and inconsistencies), and stylistic issues (e.g., awkward sentences and clich\u00e9s). Formal revision means rewriting to improve style and clarity; making major changes in content and organization; moving and rewriting entire paragraphs, sections, chapters, or other long parts; and making the writing more coherent and understandable.

Writing a novel is one of the most challenging of all forms. It requires more storytelling skill than a short story. It requires more discipline and time management than a magazine or newspaper article. Novel writing requires planning, research, long periods of solitary work -- and hard work.    That said, I'm going to share what I feel are the top ten tips for writing a novel. They come from my own experience and they probably won't surprise you:       - Start writing as soon as you have a story idea. Don't plan too much beforehand; just write something - anything! - every day. Setting up a blog is a great way to make sure you write something every day.    - Have confidence in your abilities.    - Visualize the story as you write.    - If you ever get stuck, draw on your personal experiences.    - Cut anything that is boring or unnecessary.    - Don't be afraid of writing horrible sentences or paragraphs.    - Finish what you start, whether you feel inspired or not.    - If you are feeling writer's block, writing prompts can help.    - Before writing your novel, watch for interesting ideas and research that you can draw upon. Keep a file.    - When dealing with problems in writing, searching online is probably the best way to find answers.       Writing a novel certainly requires a big commitment of your time and energy, but a lot of that effort is just dealing with problems as they occur. Hopefully by anticipating those problems and having some tools ready, you can handle them with less stress and frustration.    It may seem hard to believe, but having much more writing experience is not on the list! If you write every day and keep the tips above in mind, I promise you will become a much better writer, regardless of your current abilities.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"If you want to write a novel, here are some points you may want to consider in order to make the whole process a little easier.

Of course, novels have been written by many young people, students, and some people not at all serious about writing, but it wouldn't be wise to do otherwise without a commitment and a plan.    The level of work can be overwhelming. And then there is the emotional side of it: writing a novel requires desire and dedication. You need to be ready to deal with issues concerning belief in yourself, procrastination, fear, resistance, habits, forgiveness - you name it. Some people get discouraged after working so hard on a novel and learning that they are not going to be rich and famous. Others get angry when they can't find a publisher and quit before they finish the book. Even though there is much you can do to avoid these problems (see How to be a writer), it is still wise to be prepared.    Novels are written from the start to the finish. Unlike short stories, where the impact is at the end and the story can therefore be as short as needed, novels require careful pacing and must build gradually to a climax and resolution. There is no single \\\"process\\\" through which all novelists pass, some begin by writing the climax or the resolution of their stories first, but whatever the technique, the end product must be well paced and complete.    Novels are composed of characters, which usually involve conflict. \\\"Conflict\\\" does not necessarily mean fighting, it means that your story is made with events that clash, so that there is an issue that the characters have to face and resolve, or at least deal with. The two characters who have to deal with each other should be sufficiently different from each other to make it interesting.    Novels have a plot, a storyline and one or more main themes.    Novels employ language, but unlike poetry, which focuses on the language itself, the language in novels mainly serves the purpose of describing story details and expressing what characters do and say.    Novels can belong to a genre, which has guidelines, conventions and expectations. Romance, westerns, fantasy, science fiction and mystery novels are classified as specific genres. Literary fiction is not a genre.    Novels can have subplots or other devices to improve the story, but they are not required.    Novels have a beginning and an end, even if it is an ambiguous ending.    Novels cannot be written in a few hours.    Novel writing is not a linear process.

Writing a novel is one of the biggest writing projects you can take on. A novel can be 40,000 words, 80,000 words, 100,000 words, or more. This makes the novel a long and complicated project. When it is finished, your novel should have       - A plot - things should happen in your story. Something should be stopping your characters from getting what they want, and then the characters should try to overcome those things.    - A setting - your story should take place somewhere, and you should be able to hint at what the setting is like through your descriptions.    - A theme - your story is probably about something. It might be about love, terrorism, justice, or friendship.       In order to make your story feel like a real story that draws people in and holds their interest, you need conflict, puzzles to figure out, humor, strong emotions, and/or suspense. Your characters need to have a strong personality that make them feel like real people. You need dialogue to show the interaction between characters. You should give your plot twists and interesting events.    Writing a novel is a large project, and sometimes it helps to break the project down into smaller pieces that feel more manageable. You can do this in lots of different ways: by focusing on the story outline as one part of the project, the initial character sketches as another, the story itself, then the editing phase.     Then you would schedule writing time, either for the entire project or for each little piece. You may find it helpful to have a daily or weekly word count goal, so that you can see that you are making steady progress.    Your novel most likely will need to be edited, sometimes several times, before it is finished. This might include rewriting, fixing pacing, spelling and grammar, and much more.

Once you have completed your draft, go back and edit it to make sure your story is clear, free of errors and in a sensible order. Don't be afraid to cut out things that don't work. Consider asking a friend or family member to read it and give you feedback.    Do not worry about the time it will take to finish. Focus on developing a schedule and then following it.

Make a writing schedule     Each writing project is unique. Find a plan that works for you and stick to it.    - Write for a specific amount of time each day, or for a certain number of days per week.    - Aim for a particular number of words, pages, paragraphs, or chapters each day or week.    - Set a reasonable deadline for yourself. Your timeline should be aggressive enough to keep you motivated, but not so aggressive it becomes stressful.     Find an outline that suits your story     Before you start writing, try to make sense of your story. Getting your ideas down on paper or computer will help you carve out a clear path through the story writing process. You don't need to plan every scene and every character, but you'll want to know roughly who your characters are, where the plot is headed, when the story takes place, and where the story happens.    There are many ways to plan and organize. Try these:    - Make a flowchart or mindmap of characters and plot.    - Write a summary paragraph of your story.    - Write a list of events that need to happen or a list of characters.     Focus on you     Writing a story is a major creative endeavor; of course it makes you feel big emotions! Some people find that it helps to imagine a supportive, loving cheerleader that lives in the back of their minds. Could be you, it could be your best friend, or a kind family member.

Sometimes the sheer act of writing is all you need to get you back.    Back to basics    Look back to the last thing you wrote that you liked. Where did you leave off?

Sometimes making things easier is all you need to get going again.     Write a description - a long one - of your characters, your setting, your plot, or your theme. It might be easier to write about your story than it is to write it.     Step back and take a break       Take a walk. Breathe in the fresh air youve been missing. Stretch.

Well, this article is for you! This article will try to answer the questions of how to write a novel. But don't expect a recipe for writing a novel - there isn't any. When writing a novel, you'll have to work hard, make revisions and revisions, and finally get it published by a commercial publisher. When I began writing my first novel, I committed myself to working on it an hour a day, except for Saturdays, when I worked on it two hours. So I wrote for sixty minutes every day, Monday through Friday, and two hours every Saturday morning. After committing myself to one hour per day, five days a week I began getting letters from people about how to write a novel. So I replied with some information I hope will help you as well. Are there any secrets when it comes to writing a novel? The only secrets there are to writing a novel are focus and follow through. You must be focused in your attention on the actions involved in writing a novel, particularly when the action is on the computer! (For me, writing a novel means keyboard time!) And you must follow through on that focus, even when you don't feel like it - write anyway. There is no other way to become a novelist. Good novelists begin where you are now and incrementally improve their writing skills and knowledge. When I began writing novels, I was terrible! Now, my writing is not as bad. I'm a published novelist. Are you a published novelist? I have learned many valuable lessons in writing novels. Do you know what they are? All writing is rewriting. Successful novelists revise and revise and revise. Revision is where the work goes on after the words have been written. If you finish your first draft and leave it at that, you have not finished your novel. What you must learn about writing novels is how to finish your novels - not necessarily how to write new novels. Sol Stein, author of SOL STEIN'S WRITING IS A JOKE, shares: \\\"A novel is a skeleton that has to be fleshed out, brought to life, and done over and over again until it sings.\\\" Do you think writing a novel is easy? Have you ever started writing a novel and stopped because you felt stuck and didn't know where to go from there? If so, come back on Saturday and look for my article Finding a Writing Buddy - Novel Writing Support. When writing a novel, the support of other novelists is invaluable. For now, I hope you will write something - a poem, a short story, a personal essay, or a novel - for the fun of it and to get into practice. After all, writers write! So, the bottom line is: you must write. Writing is hard work, sometimes you get stuck, and sometimes you just don't feel like writing. But, it is well worth it. It is a wonderful art form, and there is no greater joy that publishing your heart for all to see. You can do it!

While plenty of writers try to outline their novel in minute detail before drafting any actual text, not all novelists work this way. Plenty of writers prefer to write organicly, allowing their story to evolve as they write. You won't know what's right for you until you experiment. However, a commitment to finishing is more important than your first draft looking perfect. As you revise, you'll be able to spot holes in your plot, and fill them. At first, you should focus on creating a rough draft, which does not have to be perfect. You will have time afterwards to revise and edit until your draft is the best it can be. Once you start writing, you should aim to get a complete first draft finished. Completing a first draft is a huge milestone. Don't get bogged down in making the first draft perfect. Finishing a draft is far more important. Writing a novel is a lot of work, and it's normal to feel stuck or want to quit when things aren't going the way you imagined. Don't give up. If you find you are stuck, try working on another part of the story. If you are having trouble focusing, it might help to take a break for a few days or even several weeks. Everyday life gets in the way of writing for most people. Try to schedule a certain amount of time to write, and stick to it. Writing on a schedule will help you stay on track on your novel. Writing a little bit every day, rather than a long time once in a while, is generally more effective. Holding yourself to a schedule will tremendously increase the odds that your novel will get done.

Follow these steps, and you are on your way to writing a novel of your own.       - Decide what the story is about. It's okay to start with a character, or a situation, or a setting. But sooner or later, you'll need to know what your story is about.    - Decide the point of view. Is the narrator a character in the story, like Captain Ahab? Or an outside narrator telling us what the characters do?    - Decide on a setting. Setting isn't just backdrop; it helps tell the story. A day at the beach is very different from a day in prison.    - Decide on your characters. Write a few paragraphs for each of the main characters which describe their appearance, manner of speech, time period, living environment, personality, habits, hopes and dreams, and basic conflict.    - Prepare an outline. You'll find more information on the different types of outlines here.    - Set a writing schedule. Don't mistake inspiration for discipline. One 30-minute session in front of your computer keyboard is adequate if you do it regularly.    - Set a daily word count goal. For example, a novel is usually about 50,000 words, so if you write 1,000 words a day, you will finish the first draft in 50 days.    - Sit down and write.    - At the end of the project, read your manuscript from the beginning like a reader when you get tired of writing like a writer.    - Edit your novel.

Inside of chloroplasts, there is a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The chlorophyll absorbs the energy from the sunlight and changes it into chemical energy.    The next phase of photosynthesis is called the Calvin Cycle. During the Calvin cycle, the energy that was captured and changed in the first phase, powers the reactions to build sugars. The Calvin Cycle is a little more tricky to understand than the first phase. The basics are that carbon from carbon dioxide is combined into an organic molecule in a process that is known as carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is powered by energy (ATP and NADPH) that was created in the light-dependent reactions.    When two cycles of the Calvin Cycle are complete, a glucose molecule is formed.

Virtually all life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. It is the foundation of the food chain, and it is the most powerful source of reducing power on the planet. Photosynthesis shapes our environment, and it affects how ecosystems behave.    Because photosynthesis plays such an important role on Earth, growing plants can affect nutrient cycling both locally and globally. Nutrient cycling involves the transfer of nutrients from one organism to another, and between organisms and the physical environment. Plants play an important role by removing carbon and nitrogen from the soil and atmosphere through photosynthesis. They then release it into the soil when they die and decay.    Photosynthesis is important for improving the quality of our air as well. Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere that contributes to global warming. Because plants do photosynthesis by using carbon dioxide, they remove some of this gas from the air. More on greenhouse gases can be found at EPA's Global Warming site.

The conversion of unusable sunlight energy into usable chemical energy, still leaves us with the question - how are simple carbon molecules, water and sunlight combined to make sugar?     During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres. These proteins sit in a special membrane: the thylakoid membrane of plants and algae, and the plasma membrane of photosynthetic bacteria. The reaction centres use the absorbed light energy to energize electrons. These electrons pass through an electron transport chain, releasing energy that is used to make ATP and reduced NADP (NADPH). This set of reactions is called the light-dependent reactions.     During the light-independent reactions, the electrons added to NADP+ to make NADPH are added to carbon molecules to build sugars.

Plants solve this problem with their environment.  The energy in the environment comes from the sun. Light is a form of energy. Plants use the energy of light to make food. The process by which plants make their food is called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. They take in water (H2O) from the soil.

The best way to learn something is to practice it - this applies to studying. The more you practice studying the better it gets. Give some new techniques a try to find what works for you. Just remember that the key to retention is repetition. Repetition strengthens the network of neurons that make up each memory and strengthens the links between memories.     Here are three options to consider:       - The SQ3R Method     - Spaced Studying     - Study Quizzes        The SQ3R Method    The SQ3R Method was first introduced in a 1946 book entitled, \\\"Methods of Study.\\\" You can think of it as a method that helps you read an article, book, etc by reading it with a purpose. The steps are:              - Survey - Look over the headings, subheadings, and any images/diagrams.     - Questions - Turn the headings or subheadings into questions.     - Read - Read to answer the questions.     - Recite - Put the item down and recite, in your own words, what you learned.     - Review - Review the material you just learned to better commit it to memory.              Spaced Studying    Most students study for exams over several days. But how much time should be spaced in between each session? Spacing your study sessions a little bit apart helps you have better long-term retention of information. But the spacing depends on how much time you have before your exam.     The table below shows recommendations for space intervals according to how long you have before the test.        How much time you have before the exam     How to space your study sessions       1 week    Space your study sessions 1 day apart       2 weeks    Space your study sessions 2 to 3 days apart       1 month or more    Space your study sessions 5 to 7 days apart             Study Quizzes     Study quizzes can be very helpful. Self-testing helps you learn the material as you test yourself. Correct answers provide confidence and incorrect answers reinforce your learning when you review the materials.     Here are some ways you can quiz yourself:             - Write questions, based on the key concepts being studied, then test yourself or have someone else test you.     - Use flashcards. Write a key word, idea, or concept on the front and the definition or information on the back. You can make a quiz with the front of the card being the question and the back being the answer.     - Take available online or textbook quizzes. Some eBooks, like the Federal Benefits: Retirement Handbook, have quizzes. After reading a chapter, you can take the quiz and get immediate feedback on your answers.

Getting started       - What is the best way to review: aloud or silently? - The best way to review is aloud. When a new word or concept is learned, say it aloud and say what it means, then try to use it in a sentence. For example, \\\"Cecilia is mellifluous; she has a sweet voice.\\\" You are using hearing and sight, and saying the word yourself helps unify all movements in the central nervous system.       - How do I prepare for a test? - To prepare for a test, make sure you understand the assigned reading, and answer as many of the questions at the end of chapters or units as you can. Answer the practice questions provided by your teacher, and make your own flashcards and tests. Group study also may help.    - How do I get myself to really study? - The keys to motivation are closing the door so you won't be interrupted, setting a timer, and having all your supplies ready.

You may need to experiment to find what works best for you. To get started, here are some things you can try. They may help you make the most of your study time.    - Have a plan and start early     - Decide how much time you want to spend studying. Decide what you need to accomplish during that time. Then get started.     - Shorter is better. Six separate 50-minute sessions are far better than an all-night cram.    - Organize your study zone     - Choose a place that has good lighting and space for spreading out your materials.    - Choose a place that is free of distractions and stored temptations. That may mean studying somewhere other than your dorm room of apartment.    - Make sure you have everything you need before you start - pens, paper, textbooks, computer, etc. Getting up to search for something will make it harder for you to refocus.    - Minimize distractions     - If you cannot study at home alone, choose a coffee shop or a library and commit to spending set amounts of time there.    - Turn off the television. It is hard to study when you are trying to listen to commercials.    - If music helps you concentrate, have some \\\"study music\\\" to put on.     - Take breaks     - Frequent short breaks during study sessions help your brain absorb information.     - Get up and walk around between study sessions.    - Drink plenty of water and eat healthy snacks.    - Pay attention to class     - The hardest part of learning something is getting it into your brain the first time.     - Take careful notes in class. It is easier to concentrate on the lecture if you do.    - Some people find it helpful to tape lectures so they can listen again. Check with your teacher first.    - Listen carefully and ask questions - don't just wait your turn to speak.     - Use your time outside of class     - It is easier to study material you are already somewhat familiar with than to learn it for the first time.     - Before class, review your notes from previous lectures and read the material for the upcoming class.    - After class, review the notes you took in class that day and fill in any blanks. Then test yourself on the key points - review the previous lecture before starting the next one.    - When reading make sure you understand what you are reading. Look up unfamiliar words or concepts. Highlight or underline key ideas and terms.    - Keep track of deadlines so you are sure to have enough time to study. The more time you have, the better.    - Use memory aids     - Arrange things into logical sequences     - Learning to use a table of contents to navigate your textbook allows you to search a smaller list, such as a chapter, to find what you are looking for. Organizing material into an outline is another way to learn a logical sequence.     - Use flash cards     - Flash cards help you to learn and review new terms and concepts. Place the term you are learning on one side of an index card and the definition or explanation on the back. Have a friend or family member quiz you, or quiz yourself.     - Use mnemonic devices: they make the material more meaningful and make it easier to remember     - Examples include rhymes, songs, or acronyms (such as using HOMES to remember the names of the Great Lakes: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).    - Use pictures, charts and graphs     - Draw pictures, charts and graphs to help facts and ideas stick in your mind.    - Try to relate what you are studying to your own life and experiences    - Write the information    - Writing notes over again either by hand or on the computer helps your brain retain the information.     - Repeat things to yourself     - Repeat facts or concepts that you need to memorize out loud.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Good study habits can help you make the most of your study time.

Distributing study results in better long-term retention of the material. Practice testing - Practice tests usually involve trying to recall information without having it in front of you. Practice tests can be flashcards, fill-in-the-blank tests or full practice tests that mimic the one you will be taking. (You don't have to grade it). Interleaved practice - Interleaved practice is a learning strategy, where you mix, or interleave, multiple subjects or topics while you study.

Descartes removed all of the other aspects of existence and reason that were previously accepted by default, so that he could rebuild belief from the ground up.

He attempted to understand human beliefs and created the environment for others to create the basis of modern philosophy. Socrates was fascinated by our knowledge and our awareness of it. He seems to be saying that we are wise to recognize our shortcomings.

Socrates was tried and convicted for treason, and condemned to death by poison. This was a surprise to him, because he did not believe he had done anything wrong. He believed that doing wrong harmed the soul, so why would anyone wish to harm the soul by doing wrong? Hence, he was not afraid to die; he thought it was a greater evil to commit injustice than to suffer injustice. Socrates wanted to escape, but he did not want to give up the chance to convince the jury that they were committing injustice. At the same time, if he wanted to become immortal in fame, he must first die; so he let his enemies condemn him. On the way to his death, he took the opportunity to point out to Crito: \\\"the unexamined life is not worth living.\\\" 2. \\\"God is dead.\\\" - Nietzsche. Nietzsche was famous for his criticism of religion and morality. Famous for \\\"God is dead\\\" (from The Gay Science), Nietzsche's statement was that the Enlightenment had 'killed' the possibility of belief in a coherent, traditional God. He saw that only good would remain if there was a Holy God, and only evil if there was not.  3. \\\"A man is what he makes of himself.\\\" - Jean-Paul Sartre. This statement can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Sartre, a leading existentialist, indicated that humans have freedom and choice. What this means is that you and I are not forced to do anything; if there is any type of thing that we can choose to not do, it follows that we can also choose to do it. The freedom that humans have is tantamount to the freedom of God, and humans have no excuse for their behavior. Choosing something is to take responsibility for that thing, and so in particular humans take responsibility for the whole of their lives. So if you are what you make of yourself, you are not made by: genetics, your parents, your life, or society. You are always free to choose to be something else. This is why Sartre said that \\\"man is condemned to be free.\\\" A metaphorical understanding of this statement is that life has no predetermined meaning and a person who lives this way is not being true to existentialism.

Getting enough sleep Getting enough sleep is important. Most adults need 7 or more hours of good-quality sleep each night. Children and teens need even more sleep than adults, and may also benefit from having a set bedtime. Lack of sleep has been linked to many health problems, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Plus, not getting enough sleep can affect hormone levels that control hunger. You may end up wanting to eat more than usual and gain excess weight. Sleep deprivation may also cause a lack of energy, affecting your motivation to be active. At the other end of the spectrum, getting too much sleep (more than 9 or10 hours regularly) can also make you feel sluggish.     Choose healthy meals and snacks    The foods you choose are a main source of vitamins and minerals for your body. Make each bite count. That means choosing whole, healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy). Skip highly processed foods, which are higher in calories and often have added sugar, saturated and trans fats, and sodium. When you eat them, watch your portion sizes. Also, pay attention to your hunger. Ask yourself \\\"Am I really hungry? What do I want to eat? How hungry am I?\\\"    Drinking enough water    Our bodies are 60 percent water. Water is in every cell, tissue and organ in your body. Without it, you can't survive. You lose water every day through your skin, breathing and urine. You need to replace it by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water. How much water you need depends on many factors, including your body size, activity level, the weather where you live and your health. A common idea is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. But that might not be right for everyone. A good rule of thumb is to drink water when you are thirsty and drink enough to satisfy your thirst.     Every movement counts!    A habit everyone should strive for is to move your body every day, such as taking a thirty-minute walk. More important is to limit the amount of time you spend sitting.

There are multiple feedback mechanisms and other external factors that influence Earth's climate. Some of these influence temperature, whereas others influence things like precipitation. Some of these mechanisms occur very rapidly, whereas others take place over longer periods of time. Below are climate mechanisms that are active currently. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms (and the relative strength of their influence on climate) also depends on one's location and altitude. Atmospheric composition - Atmospheric composition includes the amount of gases, liquids, and solids in the air that surrounds the Earth at any given time. Atmospheric composition can change quickly or slowly, depending on the factor influencing it. For example, the amount of water vapor in the air changes frequently, whereas the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) changes over longer periods of time.  Atmospheric composition can also be influenced by human activity, such as fossil fuel burning or land clearing, which releases CO2 and other gases, solids, and liquids into the air. Depending on the type of matter that is present in the atmosphere, that matter either retains or repels heat. For example, greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2 absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere. Other gases, like sulfate aerosols, reflect shortwave radiation from the sun, cooling the planet. The overall effect is that a portion of solar energy that reaches Earth is absorbed and some is reflected back into space. Together, the influences that warm or cool the climate system are referred to as climate forcings. Forcing can be either positive (tending to warm the surface) or negative (tending to cool the surface). The net forcing is a key factor in how much warming Earth has and will experience. Earth-Sun orbital changes - For the past one million years, Earth's climate has experienced a cycle of glaciation (ice ages) and warming. In general, these ice ages occur when Earth's orbit is more circular and the amount of solar energy that Earth receives is lower, and the warming periods occur when Earth's orbit is more elliptical and the amount of solar energy that Earth receives is higher. Milankovich cycles affect the amount of solar energy that Earth receives. This, in turn, affects atmospheric composition (especially water vapor) and temperature. Volcanic activity - Volcanic activity can influence climate on long and short timescales. Volcanic activity occurs when magma (melted rock) escapes from the interior of Earth. This can happen in several ways, including lava flows, volcanic ash clouds, and sulfur dioxide emissions, which block solar radiation from reaching the surface of the Earth. Volcanic activity also releases GHGs, including CO2 and water vapor.    Solar variation - Sunspots are temporary magnetic regions of intense activity on the sun. These can cause solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which have the potential to disrupt Earth's climate system. Solar activity isn't directly linked to Natural Climate Solutions. However, changes in the amount of solar energy reaching Earth can influence the climate.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the climate changing over thousands of years. The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.     Worldwide, glaciers have retreated since the end of the Little Ice Age (about 1850), and snowfall required to sustain glacier formation has decreased. In addition, Arctic sea ice has been retreating and thinning at an accelerating rate. Evidence from tree rings, coral, and ice cores shows that the 20th century warmed faster than any previous century in at least the last 1,300 years.     Earth is warmer now than it was in the recent past. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests, have dramatically increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Many of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for many years. Increasing concentrations of these gases trap heat near the Earth's surface.

Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just as our climate warms, it has also cooled. However, when we look at warming in the past it was always followed by Earth cooling. In fact, the Earth has, in general, cooled over the last 5 million years. Something is happening now which is different. Our climate today is warming without cooling having taken place first.    So, what causes Earth's climate to change? It could be changes in sunspot frequency, changes in the Earth's orbit, changes in greenhouse gases, changes in ocean currents, or even volcanic activity. These items are often called \\\"forcings\\\" - a forcing is an imposed perturbation of the Earth's energy balance. Natural forcings that affect climate include variations in the sunlight reaching Earth (sometimes referred to as insolation) and changes in the volcanoes that emit smoke and gases (including greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere.    Today, human activities are the main cause of climate change. The biggest contributor is burning fossil fuels, which produces heat-trapping gases. Over the last 150 years, levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

The key is to act early.    \\\"Burnout leaves us listless and exhausted and makes us stray from our life goals and lose motivation,\\\" says psychologist Christina Maslach, Ph.D., of the University of California at Berkeley. \\\"It also limits our feelings for other people and lowers productivity. By the time we experience burnout, our energy and motivation are already very low.\\\"    Stress is a normal part of life. If we have to deal with a problem, it makes sense that we would feel stressed. Burnout is different from everyday stress, though. It is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It usually happens when you feel overwhelmed and unable to keep up. Burnout can lessen your ability to feel sympathy for others and make it difficult to build relationships.    Recognize the signs    Everyone's experience with burnout is different. However, there are certain signs that may indicate that you are suffering from burnout:       - Feeling tired and drained most of the time    - Lowered immunity, frequent illnesses    - Habitual headaches, back pain    - Changes in appetite or sleep habits       Psychological signs of burnout can include a sense of failure and self-doubt; feeling helpless, trapped and defeated; detachment, feeling alone in the world; loss of motivation; increasingly cynical and negative outlook; decreased satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.    Prevent burnout    Sometimes it is hard to act before you feel yourself falling into burnout. It is best, though, to try to prevent it. The following tips can help: If you are feeling exhausted, you need rest. Take breaks throughout the day. Getting up from your desk for a short walk or doing some stretching exercises can mean the difference between coping and burning out. Try to get more sleep. Childcare, commutes, deadlines, late events, and social outings often cut into sleep, which leaves you tired and less able to cope. Perhaps by cutting back on social events, you will be able to catch more ZZZs.    Reassess your priorities. Does your day revolve around putting out fires at work? Do you spend too much time cleaning, with co-workers who stress you out, or with friends you don't really enjoy? Make time for things that are important to you, such as your family or exercise. Review your goals and values, and work on living a life consistent with them.\\n Clean up your diet. An excess of caffeine is likely to make you keyed up and jumpy. A diet high in refined sugar and fat can make you feel sluggish. Try to eat healthy balanced meals whenever possible. Find ways to relax and unwind. Yoga, massage, meditation, self-hypnosis, acupuncture, progressive muscle relaxation, or simply a hot bath can help.    Establish boundaries. Don't overextend yourself and learn how to say no. Avoid people who stress you out and limit your exposure to news broadcasts and books that deal with negative topics. Surround yourself with positive and happy people.    If you are feeling unappreciated or taken for granted, make yourself a priority. Treat yourself to something special.       Components of burnout    Burnout has three key components: exhaustion, cynicism, and a feeling of inefficacy and lack of accomplishment. Getting involved in activities can help you lessen these feelings: try to avoid procrastination, switch up your routine, and take on challenges to increase your feelings of accomplishment. Getting support from other people can help, as well.

The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.    One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is the structure of the data. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled. A database structures its data into tables whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible time line of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled it is set in stone and becomes a part of this time line. Each block in the chain is given an exact time stamp when it is added to the chain.         Image source: Blockgeeks    Blockchain databases store data in blocks that work like individual pages of a ledger or record book. Each block stores data about transactions that have taken place, similar to transactions that are documented in a checkbook register. Each block also stores two timestamps: one that shows when the block was created, and one that shows when a transaction took place. Each block contains a unique code called a hash, that distinguishes it from all other blocks. Hash codes on blocks change based on the information stored inside the block, so if someone tampers with the data in a block, the hash code will change. Altering the information on a block would change the hash code, so the blocks would no longer link together properly. This makes blockchains very secure.    Blockchains are a network of computers, each of which store a copy of the entire database. No copy is more important than the other, the network checks itself regularly to make sure everyone is synchronized. When the system works normally, everyone on the system has the same information. This network system means that no one person or group has ownership over the database, and everyone who uses it can trust the data because it is maintained automatically by a distributed network.

The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.    One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is the structure of the data. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will also be added to the chain once filled. A database structures its data into tables whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline.

For these reasons, you may also have heard blockchain described as a \\\"shared distributed ledger.\\\"    Blockchain network participants (businesses, individuals, and others) can follow transactions and see history of asset transfers for their network, in real time. Because of the decentralized and shared nature of the blockchain, there is no single version of the truth. The network reaches consensus on the validity of a transaction. The shared ledger must be updated by all participants. This makes blockchain highly resistant to outages and tampering.    How does a blockchain network work? Here is a simple example: Imagine a business blockchain network that tracks fresh fish from ocean to grocery store.  - The Fisherman catches fish and ships them to the processing plant. He records the transaction in the blockchain network using an app on his phone.  - The Processor receives the fish, packs them, and ships them out. He records the transaction in the blockchain.  - The Distributor receives the packaged fish and ships them out to the grocery stores. He records the transaction in the blockchain.  - The Grocery store receives shipments of fish, and logs the transaction into the blockchain.    In this example, at any time, network participants could look up to see where the fish are, their quality, and whether they were required to pay a higher price.

It's a technological advance that has already affected many people. After all, you probably know someone who owns bitcoins, virtual currencies that use blockchain to track transactions. However, blockchain as a technology is much more than just a ledger for buying and selling bitcoin.     A blockchain is a type of database. It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. In the case of bitcoin, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control-an ideal situation for money. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.     Other potential uses for blockchain       - Smart contracts. An example of a smart contract would be a vending machine. When you put a dollar into a vending machine, there is a specific set of actions that the machine will take. It checks if the dollar is valid, whether the selection you pushed is available, and if all conditions are satisfied, a bag of chips or a can of soda is dispensed.    Unlike a normal legal contract, a smart contract can automatically monitor conditions and take action once conditions are met. These can be used for many different purposes, including real estate purchases, medical insurance, or even in the sharing economy.    - Internet of Things. The increased adoption of IoT devices has brought a lot of attention to the security involved in the new network of connected devices. Blockchains may be able to help here. Researchers have suggested ways to use blockchain technology as an added layer of security to protect the Internet of Things.    - Supply chains. Tracking items as they move through a supply chain is a potential use for blockchains.     - Others. Whether it's certification of college or university attendance or a birth or death certificate, they are both a sort of record. If records are blockchain based, they are much harder to forge.    Food safety is another area where blockchain is growing in popularity. Food safety is complicated. In the event of a problem, the affected foods must be rapidly identified and removed from store shelves. Blockchain's ability to trace the path a food takes as it moves through the system offers the potential for fewer illnesses from contaminated food, and less food waste.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

However, blockchain technology is still being explored for other applications, including electronic voting, proof-of-location, cloud storage, digital identity, smart contracts, financial services and the internet of things.     The blockchain is the digital ledger that records bitcoin transactions. Every time a block stores data about the transactions, it is added to the blockchain. The process of how the block is added is called mining. It involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The participant that first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the blockchain and claim the rewards. The rewards, incentivizing mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin.

Learn to identify each feeling by name. If you're feeling a combination of feelings at once, try to name everything you're feeling. For example, someone who's both angry and sad might express their feelings as annoyed, frustrated, disappointed, hurt, or resentful. Understanding your feelings will help you better understand those of others. Practice empathy - Pay close attention to the people around you and try to understand how they're feeling and why. You can practice by watching television shows or movies (watch just the faces and listen to the tone of voice), observing people at the park, or playing games with your kids that involve make-believe. Everyone feels better when understood, and empathizing with someone is one of the biggest gifts you can give them. Learn conflict resolution skills - The basis of most conflicts is that people don't understand each other. Understanding your own feelings and practicing empathy are key parts of making peace. Find ways to relieve stress - Feeling calm and relaxed helps you respond appropriately to strong emotions, which is an important part of emotional intelligence.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The ability to recognize emotions in yourself and others is called emotional intelligence.

When your carbs are so low that your body switches to burning fat in your liver instead of sugars from carbs for fuel, it is called ketosis.

The \u201cketo diet\u201d is simply using food to drive your body into ketosis. In this state, your body is burning fat for fuel instead of sugars that come from carbs. When you eat a lot of carbs your body burns those carbs for energy, but when fats become the primary fuel it means your body is in a fat burning state, or ketosis.     This is actually astonishingly easy to achieve, but short-term side effects can include constipation, high cholesterol, acidosis and loss of energy. Over time, some people benefit from improvements in their blood sugar control, cardiovascular risk factors, appetite control and neurological diseases. Some people, mainly those with epilepsy, actually need to be careful and not dissipate ketones.     Diets high in carbs and low in fat seem to promote leptin resistance, which is why you find so many people have trouble losing weight on them.    A ketone is simply another form of energy that our bodies can use instead of glucose. After our bodies burn through the glucose from our diets, we then start breaking down stored body fat into ketones. You can tell if you are producing ketones by measuring your ketone levels with special sticks you can pick up at the pharmacy, or with a meter.

It is a more extreme form of the low carb diet. The goal on the ketogenic diet is to get your body into a state of ketosis: A metabolic state where your body burns fats for energy rather than carbohydrates. In a state of ketosis, your body is burning fats rather than carbohydrates. On most diets, carbohydrates supply your body with glucose for energy. But on a ketogenic diet, your body becomes very efficient at burning fat for energy. Fat is converted into ketones, which supply energy for the brain. Ketones provide an alternative energy source for the body, and therefore there will not be enough sugar (or glucose).    The ketogenic diet requires careful monitoring of the ratio and total number of grams of fat, protein, and carbohydrates eaten each day. Many meal plans exist to meet this requirement: those who follow the diet most rigorously check and double check their foods' fat, protein and carbohydrate content; weigh foods and use gram scales for weighing the foods; measuring cups and spoons are also standard equipment.     Since protein and carbohydrate supplies energy, they can be used instead of the fat in your diet. Eating more protein or carbohydrate means you'll be able to eat less fat. Protein can be used for energy only after the amino acids in the proteins are broken down (deaminated); carbohydrates are used after they are broken down into glucose.     Anticonvulsants are medicines used to treat epilepsy. In most clinical studies of ketogenic diet for epilepsy, the very-low-carbohydrate diet is prescribed.

It can be considered a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, where fat, protein, and carbohydrate supplies are monitored carefully on a daily basis.

Health Benefits of the Ketogenic Diet Shown in animal studies, ketogenic diets may reduce seizures, stoke rebuilding of damaged brain cells, reduce production of damaging molecules in brain cells. Results in people are less consistent but promising.     Possible Risks of the Ketogenic Diet Don t follow the ketogenic diet without medical supervision. If it is medically necessary, it will be prescribed and supervised. Aperiods of excessively high intake of fats or moderate increase in protein intake may cause more frequent seizures and medication may need to be changed. Medicines may affect your blood sugar levels, possibly leading to hypoglycemia (too low) or hyperglycemia (too high). Ketogenic diets may also have negative long-term effects, including an increased risk of kidney stones, slowed growth, and high cholesterol. More studies to assess the long-term effects of the diet are needed.    Some people report they have less energy, and that their workouts occasionally suffer and they feel weak. In traditional diets (like a low-fat diet), carbohydrates are a nutrient that quickly breaks down to blood sugar to provide the body with energy.

When your body burns fats instead of carbohydrates, it is known as ketosis.     Tips When Trying the Ketogenic Diet It is important to work with a dietician or physician when testing the ketogenic diet. Ketogenic diets are carefully designed and are individualized. For many, the diet starts with a fasting period. It is important to understand that lack of energy and tiredness during the fasting period is normal. Once the fast ends, some people feel much better and have more energy.    Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occur after starting medicine or ketogenic diet. Symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, or irritability should be reported to the medical team promptly. Medical care may be needed.

It is a very high-fat diet, with only a little carbohydrate and protein. Most people eat meats, eggs, cheese, nuts, butter, oils, and low-carbohydrate vegetables.    The diet plan was originally created in 1920 as a treatment for epilepsy. It is now being studied for other uses, such as for preventing diabetes or cancer. A recent study shows that a modified keto diet is also helping healthy people to live longer.

It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake, and replacing it with fat. The reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain. Ketogenic diets can cause massive reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has numerous health benefits. The diet was originally developed to treat neurological diseases such as epilepsy. Today it is getting frequent attention for its potential benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. In weight loss, \\\"keto\\\" diet has been used for almost a century. In 1921, Dr. Russell Morse Wilder at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, created the ketogenic diet to treat epilepsy. Although it was largely abandoned in favor of new anticonvulsant drugs, the diet has found new popularity as a weight loss diet. Weight loss from the ketogenic diet is simply a side effect of the diet's ability to normalize main brain neurotransmitters, protect nerve growth, and correct mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. A ketogenic diet also enhances energy production and utilization, normalizes blood sugar and insulin, and scavenges free radicals. When combined with a healthy, natural diet, the ketogenic diet will help you lose weight. Fat is the preferred source of energy on a ketogenic diet, rather than sugar. At a cellular level, this has a notable effect on mitochondrial metabolism, in that fat is metabolized through oxidative phosphorylation, which is far more efficient than the carbohydrate metabolism that involves glycolysis. The metabolic shift to fat burning has several other benefits for your health, including a reduction in free radical damage and increase in NAD+.   Little or no fruit or starchy vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, etc.)   You may find that eating a moderate amount of protein with high fat without a significant amount of carbohydrates (from fruits and starchy vegetables) will provide you with adequate ketones to get your energy from fat, not from carbohydrates. The numbers of grams of carbohydrates you can consume and stay in a ketogenic state will depend on your metabolism and activity level.   The diet also facilitates potent cellular and metabolic adaptations by reducing oxidative damage and inflammation (3, 4, 5). Oxidative stress and inflammation play a role in depression, so a diet that reduces these is likely to help control depression. Preliminary evidence also supports that ketogenic diets help control epilepsy and reduce sugar cravings, potentially therapeutic for people with eating disorders, and help with some other brain disorders (6, 7, 8).     Once your body is in ketosis, it burns fat instead of carbohydrates. When this happens, your body also turns fat into ketones in the liver. Ketones can supply energy for the brain. Because ketones provide an alternative fuel for the brain, ketosis has been shown to improve brain function in people with some brain diseases. For example, when children with epilepsy use ketones for fuel, instead of carbohydrate, the number of their seizures often decreases. Due to this mechanism, it has been suggested that the keto diet can improve mental function, provide more energy, reduce hunger, protect against Alzeihmer's disease and more.     Ketogenic diets are high in fat with adequate protein, and very low in carbohydrates. Typical fractions of total daily energy consumption from carbohydrates in a ketogenic diet are between less than 5% and 10%, and general guidelines specify that less than 5% of total daily energy intake should come from carbohydrates. The University of Rochester Medical center suggests that a person consuming 2,000 calories a day should have between 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrates for the day. The amount depends on the specific ketogenic diet used.   A regular ketogenic diet restricts carbohydrate consumption to usually less than 50 grams a day - and sometimes as low as 20 grams a day - which means that you have to limit foods that are high in carbohydrates, including fruits, many starchy vegetables (such as potatoes), breads and other grains, pasta, cookies, candy, and other desserts. Most ketogenic plans also limit dairy, nuts, and certain legumes (like lentils and chickpeas). This restriction of damaged foods and sugar likely plays a role in the health effects of the diet. Primary sources of food on a ketogenic diet include meat, eggs, nuts, healthy oils, and green vegetables.     Being in nutritional ketosis is not the same as being in ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition. In ketoacidosis high levels of ketones and blood sugar occur together, which does not happen in nutritional ketosis.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The ketogenic diet is a very low-carbohydrate diet, similar to the Atkins diet.

Fat is support for strong bones, healthy brain function, and a stable mood. You can get fat in your diet from meats, cream, butter and natural oils. Your body also uses fat stored in its fat cells, so it can help you lose excess weight. You should still eat plenty of green veggies and low-sugar fruits. Keep the carbs you do eat to a minimum.

It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain. Ketogenic diets can cause massive reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits.    People follow a variety of types of ketogenic diets. They are the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), the cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD), the targeted ketogenic diet (TKD), and the high-protein ketogenic diet. About 80 to 90 percent of calories on the SKD come from fat. About 5 to 10 percent come from carbs. And the rest come from protein. All of these diets put your body in a metabolic state called ketosis.    For people who want to build muscle, or athletic performance, the cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD) and targeted ketogenic diet (TKD) are options for adding carbs. With the CKD, you eat periods of higher-carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high-carb days. The TKD allows you to add carbs around workouts. These are usually best       for bodybuilders or athletes.    Often, a ketogenic diet causes weight loss without intentional calorie restriction. It is important to note that a ketogenic diet can have some negative side effects. Most people have side effects only during early adaptation to the diet. Symptoms may include lack of energy and fatigue, difficulty sleeping, nausea, digestive discomfort and especially bad breath. These symptoms are often referred to as the \\\"keto flu\\\" and typically go away in a few days.     Before making any changes to your diet, talk to your doctor or another health care professional.

More recently, it has become popular as a weight loss diet, and may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Ketosis - a metabolic state in which your body uses ketone bodies for fuel instead of glucose - occurs when the body is deprived of glucose (its main source of energy). Glucose comes from carbohydrate food sources. Without glucose, you won't have any excess blood sugar for your cells to burn for energy. Instead, you will burn fat for fuel. This process produces a build-up of acids called ketones within the body. This build-up is dangerous if too high, but the levels produced by the ketogenic diet are generally not harmful. A ketogenic diet is most commonly used to lose weight. Studies show that it is much more effective than the recommended low-fat diet. The ketogenic diet can significantly reduce blood sugar and insulin levels Does the ketogenic diet work well for cancer and other brain disorders? The ketogenic diet may lower tumor growth for certain types of cancer, and may help control symptoms in Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders. What foods fit into a ketogenic diet? This is what you will find yourself eating more of - so choose organic, grass-fed, and free-range foods where possible. These include meat, fish, eggs, butter, nuts, healthy oils, avocados, and a wide array of low-carb veggies. What should I not eat on a ketogenic diet? Processed foods and beverages, pasta, potatoes, rice, and high-sugar fruits are generally not included in the ketogenic diet. These foods are all high in carbohydrates, and when eaten will prevent you from returning to ketosis. Can I add dairy to my ketogenic diet? In small amounts, yes! Some dairy products can fit into a ketogenic diet - in fact, cheese is one of the best ketogenic diet foods. What can I drink on a ketogenic diet? While water is best, you can also drink unsweetened coffee and tea. Some of your daily fluids can also come from broth, which can help replenish electrolytes. Carbonated waters are also allowed, however, check to ensure your brand is free from carbohydrates and additives. Most low carb bars are high in fat and relatively low in carbohydrates. However, some contain added sugar so it is important to check the labels. All low carb bars tend to be highly processed - which tends to go against the goal of the ketogenic diet to eat healthy meat and vegetables.    - How do I start a Keto Diet? Building your meal plan around proteins, heavy cream, eggs, nuts, and late season produce, along with plenty of healthy oils, is a fine way to start keto.    - What is a good breakfast option for keto diet? Eggs get the gold seal of approval for meals in ketosis. Scrambled, fried in bacon fat, or eaten like many Germans enjoy them - cooked in a cup with cream and toppings - eggs are a versatile, easy breakfast item.    - Can I eat fruits on ketogenic diet? Fruits - such as apples, pears, peaches, oranges and bananas, though tasty and healthy, are very high on the carb scale. These fruits can take you out of ketosis. There are several berries that are relatively low in carbs and could be used occasionally when following a ketogenic diet, including raspberries, blackberries and strawberries.    - Is peanut butter okay and how much can I eat while in ketosis? Yes, native, unsalted, natural peanut butter can be a good addition to your ketosis diet when eaten in moderation.

Side effects of ketosis can include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and kidney stones. These can be managed by small adjustments to the diet. Long-term safety of the diet requires study.  Ketogenic diets can vary in their proportions of fat, carbohydrate, and protein. Two examples are a 4:1 ratio diet and a 3:1 ratio diet. These ratios describe the grams of fat per grams of carbohydrate plus protein, so a 4:1 ratio diet consists of four grams of fat for every one gram of carbohydrate plus protein. The 4:1 ratio diet contains 90% of its calories from fat, and the other 10% is protein and carbohydrate. For children, the classic ketogenic diet is proven effective. Adults seem to be able to approach ketosis with a lower proportion of fat in their diet than children. Not only does fat provide the primary source of energy on the ketogenic diet, but eating fat is how you'll make sure you get enough calories; if you eat too little fat, you won't get enough calories and your body will start breaking down your muscle. For this reason, fat is considered a \\\"primary macronutrient target\\\" on the ketogenic diet. Foods high in fat include nuts, cream, and butter.  The amount of protein is moderate; around one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight is recommended. This is sufficient to preserve lean body mass, which include muscle, bone, and skin. Too much protein can negatively affect ketosis. Because ketone bodies are considered a \\\"water poison,\\\" they are constantly excreted in the urine and the intensity of ketone in urine may occasionally change. Ketone levels in urine may also increase when insulin levels are low, such as when you first start the diet.  In basic terms, the keto diet works by eliminating carbohydrates from the diet and focusing on foods that are high in fat and moderate in protein.

Instead it uses fat, from your diet and your body. Your liver breaks down fat and produces ketones. These ketones become the main source of energy for your cells and organs, including your brain. Being in ketosis changes your body's chemistry and makes your body and brain to work differently than usual. Detailed ketone information can be found at NIH's USA.gov.

Then you'll start to break down protein and fat for energy, which can make you lose weight. This is called ketosis.    Ketogenic diets might contain two to four times as much fat as protein and carabohydrates combined.

If you use someone like a financial planner or registered representative to invest your money, you must give that person some information about your investment goals, time frame and risk tolerance in order for that person to make investment choices that are best for you.     The stock market is made up of a network of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, where investors meet to buy and sell shares of stock, bonds and other securities. Most stock trading happens on the stock exchanges, but you don't physically have to be on the floor of an exchange to trade there. Stock buyers and sellers can connect electronically or over the phone. The major stock exchanges in the United States include the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.     Stock market indexes are made up of the stocks of a particular group of companies. There are different indexes to measure the performance of different groups of stocks. For example, an index may measure the top 30 blue chip stocks such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average; it may measure small cap stocks like the Russell 2000; or the Nasdaq may measure technology and internet related companies.

Stock market participants are therefore able to buy and/or sell stock securities (shares of ownership in a publicly-traded company) and derivatives (such as stock options, which derive their value from stock). The stock market works through a network of exchanges; a stock exchange is one example of a stock market, and, most countries have multiple exchanges. For example, the United States has the New York Stock Exchange (the largest stock exchange in the world), the American Stock Exchange, and the NASDAQ. Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out, but today many are digital, meaning that transactions are carried out electronically. Two key functions of the stock market are to provide capital to companies for growth and expansion, and to provide investors with the opportunity to share in the company's profits.   A key concept in the stock market is stock prices. Stock prices are lights that go on and off on the ticker tape. Stock prices are based on willing buyer and willing seller negotiations on the floor of the exchange. They are influenced by many factors including overall market sentiment, current economic conditions, expected dividends, and the company's earnings growth. Over the long term, stock prices often correlate with the company's reputation and profitability, but over short periods stock prices can fluctuate widely and are more based on hearsay, rumors, reports, and investor enthusiasm. Stock prices are quoted in terms of dollar amount per share and most companies issue multiple shares of stock. Stock prices can go up (if more people want to own the stock than want to sell it) and can go down (if more people want to sell the stock than want to own it).

{"prompt": "What's the difference between AI and machine learning Any tips?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Is AI the same as machine learning? Machine learning doesn't equal AI, and AI doesn't equal machine learning. Machine learning is one of many ways of doing artificial intelligence. This visualization breaks it down: AI is a broad field of study that makes machines seem like they have human intelligence. That involves a lot of things - from planning, to natural language processing (NLP), to simulating human intelligence levels or behavior, to actual robotic control. Machine learning is a specific subfield of AI dealing with algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. For example, neural network algorithms are often categorized as machine learning, while genetic algorithms are often described as artificial intelligence. (Though there is much argument about these almost semantic level differentiations)    Tips for getting a job in AI or ML: Go back to school. The best paid computer scientists go to grad school; PhDs make more money on average than master level folks, who do better than people with just a bachelors. Anything that ports over a heavy math component counts; computer science bachelors degrees have the smallest math component out of any math intensive bachelors degree other than possibly education. The field changes quickly, but if you want a better career start in CS and a better rise in pay as you grow, here is a highly detailed non-comprehensive post on where a computer science degree can get you.    Another piece of advice for anyone switching careers: Get in while it's growing. The numbers are there. I took an intro to AI class almost 20 years ago, and from a recruiting perspective, the greatest growth in AI jobs is in AI/ML software engineer jobs: A software engineer is kind of your standard job - design, develop, test software, implement new features, fix bugs ... they're called programmers but often they don't program for a living, they engineer software. We now have specialized AI software engineers who do that same work in a machine learning context. The field is growing fast, so there's opportunity there for investment in education in this application area.    If you are just looking for information, here is a Wikipedia list of fields in artificial intelligence. (Heads up, it's huge!) Mind Reading - One application of machine learning is to estimate the mental state of a person you're looking at - by reading their brain waves, it can estimate whether they're happy or sad, angry or relaxed.    Image Recognition - An active field in machine learning is image recognition. We're already using optical character recognition to translate pictures of signs into text messages, but soon we won't be bothered by having to look at signs at all.    Predictive Algorithm - One of the things machine learning does best is to find patterns in data sets, without knowing what to look for in advance, so it can be used as a predictive algorithm to find the best path in difficult-to-explore spaces.    Look for the labor pool where you can make the labor market work for you. AI, software engineering, and computer science jobs in general are in very high demand - look at the wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics - and the degree of competition you face is roughly the number of people in the laborious process of getting ready to apply divided by the number of jobs out there. Fields like pharmacy, accounting, and nursing are winding down in terms of growth opportunities, and the competition is fierce for any opening. In computer science, just as soon as you are ready, there will be more jobs for you than there are people to fill them. And the number of people who enter the computer science field every year isn't really that large. There's not a lot of turnaround. It pays better than anywhere else to be adding skills.    Once you get started in the field, people who have worked for decades talk about having to continually learn a huge amount in order to keep up with the field. There are lots of free learning resources out there - for example, Wenhao Xu's Bars and Stripes. It lets you train machine learning algorithms on images of bars and stripes and view the inner workings of the artificial neurons in a heuristic way, so you can build an intuition about why a particular training is more accurate than another.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Machine learning is a subset of AI; it isn't the other way around.

Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence. According to Techopedia.ai:      - Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:       - Speech recognition     - Learning     - Planning     - Problem-solving              - Machine learning (ML) is a current application of artificial intelligence based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.              Why do agencies want to invest in AI?      AI tools can help you rapidly gain insights from your data. Most agencies have huge amounts of data, but turning that data into useful insights is extremely labor intensive. Resources that you could be dedicating to increasing government efficiency or to scientific discovery instead get spent on the analysis. AI can accomplish many kinds of massive analysis at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost.    However, there are some important questions you want to ask before investing in AI. AI won't provide you with effective results if you give it the wrong or incomplete data. You want to make sure that the data you give your AI tools matches your goals - your \\\"why.\\\" That starts with clearly understanding your goals including where the gaps and challenges are in your current processes.    Read White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's Artificial Intelligence for America's Future for more.       Should I become a data scientist or a machine learning scientist?      If you want to work in a job developing, implementing, or improving AI, you might want to consider becoming a data scientist or machine learning specialist. Though, again, which is the right \\\"where\\\" for you starts with your \\\"why.\\\"       - Do you want to be able to interpret and use the analyses, patterning, and predictions it generates? Start with data science.     - Do you want a more development role by building the models that enable the analyses, patterning, and predictions? Start with machine learning.       At the end of the day, you want to become good at working with data.       What is the difference between inference and training?      Artificial intelligence has two phases:       - Training: analyzes data, notices patterns, and \\\"learns\\\" - the process of teaching a model.      - Inference: uses the learned model to predict the output for new data - the process of making predictions or classifications.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"In terms AI, machine learning and deep learning all are related categories.

It may help if you look at some examples of each. Consider the task of building a system to detect credit card fraud. You could create rules to detect it and call that AI, but not machine learning.

AI means that a machine is mimicking cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as learning and problem-solving. AI has to do with algorithms, but not all AI algorithms involve machine learning - ML is a subset. ML is a type of AI that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. For example, if an AI is mimicking human cognition, it may learn the way a human learns, either on-the-job or through experience. You don't necessarily need this kind of learning for an AI to be \\\"intelligent,\\\" however - sometimes a simple program that follows a decision tree will suffice. In this case, the AI is not \\\"learning,\\\" but already knows exactly how it should respond regardless of its interactions with the user. The key difference is that AI can be programmed, it does not need to learn, and in fact may fail to do so. On the other hand, ML always learns but is not necessarily intelligent. ML is the practice of using data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. ML cannot successfully mimic human cognition without data, but it can learn without interaction (though interaction with humans can speed things along considerably). If an AI system uses a learning algorithm, it needs to receive data, analyze it, learn from it, and then use what has been learned to make predictions, calculations, and decisions. For example, if you teach a program to identify pictures of cats, you can give it a whole set of cat images so that it learns features common to cats, such as their pointy ears, whiskers, and unique face shape. When you give the program a new picture, it will use what it learned from the known pictures to identify the features and decide whether a new animal it sees is a cat or not. The more images you give it, the better it will get at the task. In contrast, a simple AI detection program might do just what humans do when they see an animal: if it has whiskers and pointy ears, it's a cat. This AI algorithm would work every time, with no learning required.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

You might find you have more time for a morning run if you don't have to spend 20 minutes doing your hair.     - Pay attention to traffic and weather. When you check the news in the morning, check the traffic the weather reports too. This could help you leave in time to avoid being late.    - Make sure you have your keys. Put them in a spot you will notice before you leave the house.    - Try to get everything you need to take to work with you the night before. If you walk in the door after work and dump your things by the door, you can remember to get your purse, briefcase, lunch or other items ready to take with you.     - If you eat lunch at work, make your lunch the night before if you can. If you don't eat lunch at work, lay out all your packing items, including your containers and everything that you are planning to pack the night before.     - Avoid looking at your cell phone or e-mail before breakfast. This can help you avoid stress first thing in the morning.     - If you have kids, try to get their things ready the night before, such as clothes, backpacks and supplies. For younger kids, you might want to get them ready (or nearly ready) the night before.    - If the kids need help getting their license in the morning, you might want to consider waking them a little sooner.     - Leave a little time for yourself in the morning. If you have an extra ten minutes before you leave, spend a little time doing something you like, such as a cup of coffee and a book, knitting, light exercise or meditation.    - Try your best to be on time. Getting out the door early can be very relaxing. You will not feel packed in during your commute. You will not be rushed when you get to work and you will not be freaking out because you are late. Getting out the door a little sooner than you really need is a great idea.     - Allow enough time for a leisurely morning. Being rushed is stressful. If your morning feels stressful, get up a little earlier. To overtime because you fell behind the night before.     - Wake up earlier if your schedule changes or if the weather gets worse. If you are sick or the schools are closed, you might need a regular morning routine.     - Be flexible, sometimes you are going to be late. If you have a good morning routine that works the rest of the time, you will be able to handle it when you do have to be late.    - Plan a little something you love as a reward for getting ready on time. This can help keep you motivated to leave on time. However, do not make the reward so big that it eats in to your time.    - Some examples of rewards might be a muffin (or even just a mini muffin), a cup of coffee with cream, a bagel and cream cheese or a special yogurt. On the weekends it could be a cinnamon roll or chocolate chip pancakes. Summer might call for a nice iced coffee or fresh juice. On the days you get to work on time, you might want to find a way to reward yourself every now and then, such as a nice lunch or a shopping trip.    - If you are a night owl and have problems getting up early, try getting to sleep earlier. Any tiredness can make stuff like this very hard. If you need it, talk to your doctor about getting help for sleep problems.     - Set an intention before your feet hit the floor. Decide on one thing that you will do for yourself that morning.

It's not an overstatement to say that how you do one thing, is how you do everything.

These take place on an unconscious level, but once you recognize this pattern you can start to work on shifting it. A morning routine that works for one person may not make sense to someone else, no matter how motivating the stories might be. Here are some of my favorites: - Write in a journal. Jerry Seinfeld and Menachem Mendel have noted that writing can help center your day. You can write regardless of the weather or temperature. All that you need is paper and a pen! You could write what you are grateful for, a quote that you like, a poem, a story, what you are feeling, what you are looking forward to, or what you can do better. - Meditate. The benefits of meditation are so great that its one of my 9 Essential Practices That Will Change Your Life. Watching your breath can help center your day. You can meditate regardless of the weather or temperature. - Do some stretches, yoga, or light exercise. Movement can help you wake up and get some of your frustrations out before your day truly begins. Exercise also has the added benefit of building your health and putting you in \\\"offense\\\" mode in terms of disease, mood, reliance on medication, and weight. My 15 Minute Yoga workout video is a short, gentle routine that most can do. I invite you to join me. - Drink tea or water. Hydrating in the morning has many health benefits. - Shower. Sometimes a hot shower is relaxing and a cold shower is energizing. Showers can be invigorating in many ways. - Make you bed. Decluttering expert Marie Kondo has said that you can start your gratitude routine with your bedding. Really appreciating what you have -- your home, a warm bed, security -- is a can-do way to start your day. - Eat a healthy breakfast. A healthy breakfast is one that isn't too heavy and not so light that you are back staring at the refrigerator door in half an hour. I am a fan of eggs, fruit, walnuts, whole wheat toast, and cottage cheese for breakfast because I find that they keep me satiated for most of the day. I don't find yogurt to be very filling, but if you substitute Greek yogurt you will be getting more protein. - Do a short version of the Dog Whisperer's \\\"Nothing in Life Is Free\\\" or \\\"NILIF\\\" for your pets. This positive discipline training method helps keep your dogs well mannered and under control. It also teaches them that working for their food is a good thing! - Take a moment for personal care. This can be relaxing and comforting. You could light a candle, listen to some music, put on some makeup, or eat a piece of high quality chocolate in a mindful way. You could even sing or dance! - Listen to or read some personal development content. This will help you center yourself, get motivated for the day, or remind you of your priorities. - Make a to-do list. Plan your day and pick 3 things that you want to accomplish during the day.

In the 1950's, the U.S. Government became concerned about its communications network. They worried that it wasn't able to stand up to a nuclear attack. In 1958, a National Defense communications network was created that linked bases and military installations within the U.S. It was called ARPANET and it stood for Advanced Research Project Agency Network. It was a project by the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET created a communications system that didn't have a single point of failure. It used packet switching that allowed many computers to communicate on a single network.     In the 1970's, scientists Robert Khan and Vinton Cerf developed a communications protocol, now called the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The protocols were adopted by ARPANET in 1983. ARPANET changed its name to the internet.     At first, only Universities, military and the scientific communities used the internet. The World Wide Web was introduced to the public in 1992. Soon after it was launched, businesses and the media started using the internet on a wide scale.

The email was created, which would become one of the most popular uses for the Internet. Also, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), commonly called TCP/IP, were developed. These protocols set standards for how computers could communicate over a network. Machines using different operating systems would be able to talk to each other consistently using TCP/IP.   Eventually the ARPANET evolved into the Internet we have today. The National Science Foundation created an even bigger network called NSFNET. It connected the regional research and education networks around the country. Before long, many other smaller networks connected to NSFNET and the networks eventually became interconnected.

The first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the second network node at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). During 1969, there were four computers connected to the ARPANET, which also connected the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. The ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the \\\"network of networks\\\" that became the modern Internet.

NSFNET eventually replaced the ARPANET as the backbone network and still exists today as the Internet. The Internet soon expanded to include a wide range of other commercial, educational, governmental and private networks.

Modern Internet (1990) In 1990, ARPANET adopted the common communication rules still used today. These rules are called TCP/IP or transmission control protocol/Internet protocol. Using the same rules made it easier to connect networks together and further expanded the growth of the Internet.    That same year, the World Wide Web was developed at CERN. It was built to allow scientists around the world to easily share information. While it was not the Internet itself, it significantly increased the popularity of the Internet by taking advantage of its ability to share information.

That network, ARPANET, soon connected universities and research facilities, then military installations, on the east coast of America.    Many developments had to happen before the global Internet came into being. Institutions needed to agree on rules to exchange information, so that the technology would work across different computer networks. These rules are called protocols. Institutions needed to do research on network hardware and software to support these protocols.    In the late 1980s, the first large computer networks started connecting. The National Science Foundation's NSFNET connected universities and research institutions in the U.S. The European Organization for Nuclear Research's network connected institutions in Europe. The National Research and Education Network (NREN) connected institutions in Canada.     Commercial networks already linked businesses and private homes within certain regions. These networks began linking together in the late 1980s, creating a network of networks called the Internet. Initially, the Internet served only as a way for researchers to communicate, exchange data and share resources.
