Given that only three of the shipments to Truax Construction consisted of building supplies (and there were four shipments total to Truax), there must be at least one shipment to Truax that was a specially ordered shipment but not a building supply.

If all of Truax Construction's shipments had been sent on Thursday, then three could be building supplies, but that leaves the question of whether a shipment existed that was not sent out on Thursday. However, given that all shipments to Truax cannot be just building supplies or sent only on Thursday, during Friday there is also the notion that at least one item must be not sent out that day due to logistics. Thus, this cannot be absolutely concluded without further evidence or total counts.\\n\\nThrough analyzing these options, **none can be categorically stated as true based on the information provided.** However, the option that may come closest to be concluded generally focuses on the intent and inventory logistics rather than any singular possibility with assurances.

Some dog owners believe their dogs are emotionally attached to them.

Milk bottlers generally do not respond to a decrease in raw-milk prices by straightaway proportionately lowering the price of the bottled milk they sell.\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe passage discusses how complaints about milk bottlers' markups are more likely to occur when the price of bottled milk rises, which often occurs due to rising raw-milk prices. It states that when raw-milk prices are falling, the bottlers' markups are greatest, suggesting that they might not lower bottled milk prices proportionately when raw milk prices decrease. Thus, option D logically follows from the information provided in the passage. \\n\\nOptions A, B, and C are not necessarily supported by the text, as nothing in the passage indicates a direct relationship between raw-milk price changes and consumer prices or dairy farmers' profits.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"To determine which of the options must also be true based on the statements provided, we can analyze the information given.\\n\\n1.
