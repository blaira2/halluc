Regular computers (and even supercomputers) have a really hard time with these problems, but quantum computers can do them more quickly. \\n    \\n- **Bit vs. qubit**: A regular computer uses tiny pieces of information called bits that can be either 0s or 1s. Like a light switch, a bit is either off (0) or on (1). A quantum computer uses qubits (pronounced \\\"cute bits\\\") that can be 0s, 1s, or both at the same time!

Quantum computers use a special kind of math called quantum physics. Quantum math is very different from the math we see every day.

{"prompt": "Can you explain quantum computing in simple terms How do I begin?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Quantum computing is a complicated topic, but you can get the gist of it with just a little background knowledge. Basic concepts and vocabulary about quantum computing are explained in this introduction. (For specific vocabulary about quantum computers, see the glossary.) These concepts are described in further detail in Quantum Computing and Quantum Computers. If you're familiar with classical computers, you might find that section helpful, too.     Quantum mechanics underlies quantum computing. Quantum computers take advantage of strange properties of quantum mechanics to process information in new ways. A quantum computer encodes information in quantum bits, or qubits.    Qubits can exist in a superposition of states, which allows quantum computers to do many calculations at once. This makes quantum computers very powerful for certain tasks. For example, one class of calculations for which a quantum computer is better than a classical computer is factoring large integers into prime factors.     The first quantum computers are now being built. Quantum computers are still in the early stages of development. Nevertheless, they have the potential to solve certain problems much more quickly than classical computers, just as classical computers can solve some problems more quickly than sliding block puzzles can.     Programs get faster through hardware upgrades. Programs designed by engineers to run on classical computers are now running more quickly because of upgraded hardware. Engineers are upgrading quantum computers so existing programs will eventually run even faster.        Quantum computing is a type of computation. Quantum computing is a method of computation. Computation refers to problem solving or calculation, especially one performed by a computer. Anything that can be turned into a number can be calculated. For example, the area of a circle, the digits of pi, and the best way to pack people into elevator cars are all calculations.     Quantum computing uses the physical properties of subatomic particles to represent information as one and zero at the same time. All information that a computer processes consists of numbers that are encoded as bits. Bits consist of 1s and 0s that represent the two possible values of a switch, on or off. Quantum computing does not replace traditional computing; it augments traditional processes for certain calculations. For example, quantum computing might improve medical diagnosis for a certain disease.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The best way to start understanding quantum computing is to look at how computers work today. A regular computer - like the one you might have at home - processes information in binary form, using electrical signals with two possible values to stand for the numbers 0 and 1. Everything that a computer does is ultimately broken down into a series of these binary values. To represent information in binary format, computers use tiny building blocks called bits. Each bit has a value of either 0 or 1.   Regular computers use these bits to perform a huge variety of tasks. For example, they can play music and videos, surf the Web, and do math calculations.   Quantum computers approach problems in different ways than regular computers do. By using a different method, quantum computers can solve certain problems much more quickly than regular computers.\\n                    \\n\\n\\n                    Learn how quantum computers work\\n                    One way to think about how quantum computers can solve certain problems much more quickly than regular computers is to compare a simple math problem to exploring a maze.   Imagine that youre in a maze and you want to find the exit. You have two choices: you can either roam around the maze and hope to find the exit or you can try to figure out the best place to go next. If you try to figure out the best place to go next, you will probably find the exit much more quickly.   The math problem is finding the quickest way to connect a series of dots on a piece of paper, or a graph, without lifting your pencil. You can either: Roam around, drawing lines, hoping to connect all the dots, or figure out the best place to go next.   A quantum computer does something like the second option for both problems. Instead of exploring possible paths one at a time, it explores all of the possible paths at once by using quantum bits instead of regular bits. The time it takes to figure out the best answer based on all the different paths is much shorter than the time it takes if you're roaming around, like a regular computer would do.\\n\\n\\n                \\n                    Discover the qubits of quantum computers\\n                \\n                \\n                    The basic building block of quantum computers is the quantum bit, or qubit. Simple quantum systems, such as a qubit, can be used to create quantum computers. The color of a single photon (light particle) or the spin of an atom can be used as a qubit and would represent the two values of a regular computer bit (0 and 1). However, unlike a regular computer bit, a qubit can represent a 0, a 1, or both 0 and 1 at the same time.      To understand how this is possible, you need to know at least a little about quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics describes how matter and energy behave on a subatomic scale. Everything in the universe is made up of atoms, and subatomic particles make up atoms. Qubits take advantage of this strange world of quantum mechanics. For example, they can use the properties of superposition and entanglement.          Superposition - When a particle, such as an electron, is in superposition, it can be in two different energy states at the same time. When one of the states is observed, it instantly goes to that state and stops being in superposition. To think about it another way, you can imagine that if a particle has a 0 and 1 energy state, it can be a 0 state and a 1 state at the same time.  Entanglement - When two particles become linked (entangled) together, even if they are very far apart from each other, the state of one particle can depend on the state of the other particle.

Here is an overview of quantum computing concepts and terminology explained for the general reader.\\n\\nWhat is quantum computing?\\nQuantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective actions of matter and light at tiny scales (atomic and subatomic). These actions are described by the science of quantum mechanics; the weird rules that explain how very small particles like electrons and photons (particles of light) interact with each other and with larger objects. Matter and energy can behave like separate bits of anything -- particles like electrons, atoms or photons -- they can also simultaneously behave like waves. Quantum computers encode information in quantum states -- such as the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon.\\n\\nQuantum computers are different from traditional computers which encode information in bits. In contrast to a bit which can only store a 1 or a 0, \\\"quantum bits\\\" or qubits can store a 1, a 0 or any quantum superposition of those states.  A traditional computer processes information using sets of bits. Quantum computers process information using a set of qubits that work together like an orchestra to complete a single piece of music.\\n\\n\\nHow do quantum computers differ from classical computers?\\nThe fundamental difference is how information is stored in bits (for a classical computer) and qubits (for a quantum computer). Here are a number of comparisons:\\n  -  Structure: A bit is like a tiny electronic switch that is either off (a 0) or on (a 1). A qubit can be any shape - it might be a tiny wire or a stream of atoms, photons or ions.    - Information: A qubit represents a 0, a 1, or both 0 and 1 at the same time (quantum superposition). This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at once. A classical computer with two bits can be in one of four possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11). Two qubits can be in a state that represents all four combinations at once. This makes quantum computers potentially more powerful.    - Entanglement: Qubits can be linked together in such a way that the action of one qubit can depend on the action of another. This links qubits into a network of relationships. This can help a quantum computer work faster and more efficiently than a classical computer.\\n\\nThe effect of superposition and entanglement explains why quantum computers hold so much promise.\\n\\n\\nWhat can quantum computers do?\\nThey will be able to perform calculations that are currently impossible for a classical computer.\\nQuantum computers hold promise to solve certain types of problems -- like simulating molecules and materials or optimizing large complex systems -- much faster than classical computers. Quantum computers will not be better than classical computers at every problem, but better at certain ones such as:\\n  - Simulating molecules, materials, and particles at the quantum level    - Searching large databases    - Factoring large numbers (which is important for encryption and cybersecurity)\\n\\n\\nWhat are some challenges to building quantum computers?\\nMost qubits are very fragile and lose their quantum properties quickly. Quantum computers need a method for ensuring that calculations remain accurate.   - Qubits become upset by high temperatures and other environmental noise. These qubit errors are called decoherence. Quantum computers need to be operating at very low temperatures or be isolated in special materials that shield the qubits from interference.\\n\\nQuantum computers also need a fast way of processing (quantum gates) that are able to correct errors quickly, to replace qubits that fail quickly, and to remove environmental noise quickly.\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

A nap during the day may help some people. But it can make sleep problems worse in others. Sleep disorders are usually diagnosed in children, teens, and adults. The most common sleep disorders include:          - Insomnia, which means you have trouble sleeping. With insomnia, you may have trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up too early in the morning. You may feel tired when you wake up. Short-term insomnia can happen after stressful life events. Chronic insomnia lasts a month or longer.  - Sleep apnea, a serious condition in which breathing stops for short periods during sleep. People with this disorder often wake many times during the night and feel tired during the day.  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) causes a powerful urge to move the legs at night while trying to sleep. A person with RLS can't help but move around. This makes it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep.    Sleeping problems often go hand in hand with other health problems. Treatment of the sleep problem may improve your quality of life and other health problems.   Sleep disorders can cause symptoms like excessive daytime sleepiness, trouble paying attention, irritability, and depression. These symptoms can affect relationships, work, or school, and even safety at home and while driving.

Sleeping pills usually do not cure a sleep problem and may stop working over time. Using sleeping pills can lead to dependence (the need to keep taking a drug to feel normal), withdrawal (feelings of illness and discomfort felt when the drug is stopped), and addiction (the need to keep taking a drug to avoid feeling ill). Many sleeping pills can also cause side effects, such as having trouble thinking, remembering, or judging distances after starting the drug. They can also cause falls or make you feel sleepy during the day.   Some ways you can protect yourself if you do take sleeping pills are:         - Ask your doctor about which pill is best for you and how long you should take it.    - Do not drink alcohol while taking sleeping pills.    - Read the patient information that comes with your pill each time you get a refill. This information may change.    - Have your doctor regularly recheck your need for sleeping pills.     - Tell your doctor if you have any side effects.        melatonin may help improve sleep hygiene. Melatonin is a hormone released by your body that helps with sleep. It is also available as a dietary supplement.

Not getting enough sleep can also lead to long-term mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Just one night of poor sleep can affect your mood the next day.   What Is Sleep Quality? Sleep quality refers to how well you sleep. It can also refer to how much sleep you get. Sleep quality includes: * How quickly you fall asleep (sleep onset). * How long you stay asleep (sleep duration). * How often you wake up during the night. * How rested you feel when you wake up.   You can improve sleep quality by getting the recommended amount of sleep and establishing a regular sleep schedule, getting enough physical activity during the day, managing stress, and practicing good sleep habits.      Do You Get Enough Sleep? Sleep needs vary by person. Most adults need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep each night. Teenagers need about 9 to 10. Children need about 10 to 12, and younger infants need about 14 to 15.    There are different ways to find out how much sleep you need: * Keep a sleep diary. You can keep a sleep diary for 1 to 2 weeks. In the diary, write down what time you go to bed at night, what time you wake up in the morning, and how much time you spend awake in bed  This can help you see patterns of sleep habits.   * Aim for a set number of hours of sleep each night. This can help you feel more rested when you wake up.   * Use a sleep device. Many smartwatches and apps can track how many hours of sleep you get each night. However, these sleep devices usually are not as accurate as an overnight sleep study in a sleep disorders center.    By the end of your first week of tracking, you should know if you are getting enough sleep. If you are concerned about your sleep or experience any of the following, talk to your doctor: * You often wake up tired and groggy rather than feeling refreshed.  * You fall asleep while watching TV, reading, or sitting in a meeting.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

This includes trying new activities, bringing your authentic self, and stepping a little outside your comfort zone.\\n\\nMeeting new people also means being open to people who are different from you. If you're used to surrounding yourself with a specific type of person, you might consider looking for friends who have different interests or experiences. You might also try looking in different places for friends, such as at work, at social clubs, in your neighborhood, or with online communities.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Making new friends as an adult can be challenging, but it is definitely possible. Here are some tips and ideas on how to meet new people and build friendships, along with things to consider.\\n\\n                    ### Tips for Making New Friends\\n                    - **Reach out to others.** Take the initiative in your relationships. This can be difficult if you are shy. Make an effort to get to know others and to stay in touch. Show interest in what others say when you are socializing. \\n                    - **Be friendly.** Smile, make eye contact, and have open body language. Respond to others in a warm way when they approach you. \\n                    - **Try new things.** Explore activities that you have never tried before, or that you have not done in a long time. This might mean joining a class or taking on new responsibilities at work. \\n                    - **Go where the people are.** To meet new people, go where the action is: -  social events -  community or religious groups -  classes or workshops -  the gym or sports events -  cultural events -  volunteer opportunities\\n                    - **Use daylight hours.** If you can, use daylight hours to meet people, especially for the first time. You may feel more comfortable as you will be around other people. Plus, connections may happen naturally, such as when you run into a neighbor in your building or at the park.\\n                    - **Keep in touch.** Follow up when you meet someone you would like to see again. Ask for their phone number or email address. Got a hint of a connection? Ask them if they want to meet sometime for a drink or cup of coffee. \\n                    - **Join a group.**  See if you can find informal social clubs. Search online for social groups or clubs. Or visit a community center bulletin board. You might meet people who are looking to make new friends as well.\\n                 \\n                \\n                    ### Things to Keep in Mind\\n                    - **Be patient.** Stay open to invitations to socialize. It can take time to meet new friends. \\n                    - **Embrace solitude.** You might feel lonely when you are at home by yourself. It may help to remember that being lonely is a natural feeling. \\n                    - **Loosen up.** Let go of worries about making a perfect first impression. We often worry too much about how we look or about impressing others. People are often kinder and more forgiving than we think.\\n                    - **Know you are valuable.** Remind yourself of your good qualities that are welcoming to others.\\n                    - **Recognize that friendship takes work.** Building a close friendship can be hard, and it might take longer than expected. You might be put off at first if you think the person is too different. But give them a chance, and talk first with people who seem warm and gentle. \\n                    - **Celebrate your friendships.** Enjoy the friends you have. If you don't feel you have enough, try to build your circle. \\\"Friendship\\\" and \\\"social connection\\\" aren't the same thing. Both are important.\\n                    - **Build connections.** Make sure the people you want to meet want to meet you, too. This can happen naturally when two people start to hang out. \\n                    \\n                 \\n                    ### Community Help\\n                    **Consider group activities.** Join a walking group, band, or community theater. These help develop connections. It can also be helpful to ask a friend or two to become more active in your life. \\n                \\n                    ### Further Help\\n                    If you are lonely, depressed, or anxious or you worry too much about who will be your friends, it can help to talk to a mental health professional.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Making new friends as an adult can be challenging, but it is certainly possible and can be a rewarding experience. There are many factors to consider when thinking about making new friends and some important tips to consider. Here are some points to help you make new friends:   \\n\\n    **Considerations about making new friends as an adult**\\n      - Friendships can change over time. You and your friends may not spend as much time together or have the same interests, needs, and priorities at different stages of your life.\\n      - Life may present barriers to gathering with friends. Other responsibilities such as family, work, and other activities can make it hard to make time for friends or meet new people.\\n      - Friendships are a two-way street. The effort needed to make new friends can be difficult for some people. Think about how much time, effort, and communication you are willing to invest in making a new friendship.\\n      - Older adults may have difficulty making new friends. It may be harder for older adults to meet new people because of their social circles, the way they are raised, health problems, or a lack of desire to make new friends.\\n      - Cultural differences can be a barrier to making friends. Different cultural backgrounds can influence friendship expectations.  \\n\\n\\n\\n    **Making new friends**\\n      - Get started. Find out whether you can work through any concerns you have about making new friends. For example, if you are worried about rejection, it may help to remember that no one is perfect. Being honest about your thoughts and feelings can help make new friends. \\n      - Think about the kind of friends you want. It may be easier to identify people you want to be friends with if you know who you are looking for. Would you like a best friend, a group of friends, or a one-time friend for an activity?     Friendships have different categories and types. Think about the different types of friendships:   \\n              -   **Acquaintance**: someone you know slightly. You may know their name, but not much else about them. You may nod \\\"hello,\\\" at each other, chat when passing on the street, or ask how their day is going without expecting more than a quick reply.        \\n              -  **Casual friend**: someone you see regularly but do not talk to often. You may say \\\"hi\\\" and ask about their family or day. This may happen if you see each other often in art class or at the office.         \\n              -  **Close friend**: someone you like to talk with and trust. You have regular chats, share a lot about your daily life, and are generally in the same place, like at home or church.  \\n                \\n      - Investigate your personal barriers to making new friends.reflect on your own personal barriers to making new friends. For example, if you naturally think of all the ways you are different from other people, you may not make friends easily.  \\n      - Care for your health. Making new friends may be hard if you are sick or tired. It is hard to be open to other people when you do not feel well. Taking care of your health can help.  \\n\\n\\n\\n    **Improve your chances of making lasting friendships**\\n      - Be willing to try. Finding new friends takes time and honesty. It is important to have a sense of humor and hopefulness.    \\n      - Ask for help. A trustworthy friend can help you be your best self or share worries and problems.

Hunker Down\\n\\nFor some things, individual actions are not enough to avoid catastrophic climate change. In the 20th century, the average global surface temperature increased about 1.4\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C), largely because of rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If the average temperature of the earth increases 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C), the consequences in some areas will be severe. Scientists disagree about how much carbon emissions should be reduced to avoid this extra warming, and climate changes already occurring have an even greater chance of causing severe effects. People may need to take actions to \\\"hunker down\\\" to protect their communities from the climate changes already starting. \\n\\n### Further Information and Resources\\n\\n- Visit the [Environmental Protection Agency website](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions) for more information about carbon emissions.\\n- Explore the programs of the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://climate.gov/news-features) to learn how to increase climate literacy.\\n- Search for a local [climate organization](https://www.sierraclub.org/earth-day/get-involved-at-home) to learn what it is doing in your community.\\n- Visit the [Carbon Footprint](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx) website for a calculator to determine your carbon footprint and what you can do to reduce it.\\n- Review [What You Can Do](https://climate.audubon.org/) about climate change on the Audubon website.\\n- Check with your local city or municipality to learn if it has an initiative for use of renewable energy.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Reducing your carbon footprint is a great way to help combat climate change.

Adopting a pet is an exciting and big decision that can involve a lot of different steps. Here are some tips you can use to help streamline the process and make sure that adopting a pet is the right choice for you.   Before You Adopt   - Think carefully about whether you should adopt a pet. Ask yourself if you're ready for the time, effort, and cost that comes with caring for a pet. Dogs and cats can live ten years or more. Be sure to research the type of pet you want to adopt so you can find one that fits your lifestyle. Get your whole family involved in the decision.   - Decide whether you want to adopt a pet from a shelter, rescue group, or if you're looking for a specific breed, a breed rescue organization.   - If you do decide to adopt, get ready! Prepare your home for your new pet by setting aside a space with food and a bed, and pet-proofing your home by making sure dangerous items are out of reach.   - Ask friends, family, neighbors, or co-workers if they know of any pets that need homes.   - Check your schedule. If you will be away from home often or for long periods of time, consider waiting to adopt a pet.   - Look for pet-friendly housing in your area if you don't have a home.   - Test your allergies. Before adopting, spend time with the type of pet you want to adopt to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction.   - Make sure you can pay for regular and unexpected veterinary visits, food, and other pet care expenses.   - If you already have pets, make sure they are current on vaccinations and talk to your veterinarian about adding a new pet to your family.   - Make sure you're allowed to have a pet in your home. Check your lease or rental agreement, if you have one. Look into pet restrictions that may apply in your area, such as breed restrictions on dogs. Some rental properties or neighborhoods may not allow dogs or require a pet fee.   - Prepare your family. Encourage all family members to talk about and agree on the type of pet to adopt and what their responsibility will be for the pet.   - Talk with your veterinarian about what type of pet would be best for your lifestyle.   - Be ready to be flexible. Although you might have your heart set on a certain kind of animal, remember that there may be some pets available that would be great for you!   - Observe your family's lifestyle for a week. If your family is busy and on the go, you might want to consider a more independent pet.   - Spend time with pets you're considering adopting.   - Ask about your state's animal laws. You can contact your local animal control agency or the Humane Society of the United States for more information.   - Prepare your pets. If you already have pets, make sure they are current on vaccinations and talk to your veterinarian about bringing a new pet into your home.    Choosing the Right Pet for You and Your Family   Animal shelters and rescue groups are good sources for finding pets. There are many different breeds, sizes, ages, temperaments, and energy levels of pets.   One way to get an idea of your family and a pet's personality is to take a personality test, like the  ASPCA's pet personality quiz, to help you identify the characteristics of the right pet for you.   -  ASPCA's pet personality quiz   -  hsus.org - find a pet    Be sure to consider adopting an older pet, as puppies and kittens require a lot of time to train and care for.

Here are some steps you will take to adopt a pet:  -  Find a shelter. Check the list at the bottom of this page to find your local shelter. You can also search Petfinder.com for pets available in your area. -  Visit the shelter or animal rescue. Talk to the staff and volunteers about the different types of pets available for adoption. The shelter personnel can help you find a pet that will fit your personality and lifestyle. -  Apply to adopt a pet. Complete an application to adopt. The application may include the following:     - Information about yourself      - Where you live      - Your lifestyle and who lives with you      - Other pets you have     - Your experience with pets     - Your job or school situation.    -  Interview. Some shelters will ask to interview you in person or on the phone before placing a pet with you. If you want to adopt a dog, the shelter may ask you to meet the dog before making a decision.   - Check pet. Some shelters require that you check your new pet with your veterinarian before you adopt it.   -  Sign adoption agreement. There may be certain rules you have to follow to complete the adoption. For example, you may have to agree to keep the pet indoors, provide proper veterinary care and license the pet.   - Pay adoption fee. There is usually a fee associated with adopting a pet, which covers the shelter's costs involved in caring for the pet. The fee will vary depending on the pet and whether it has been spayed or neutered.   - Bring pet home. Have a collar and ID tag and a leash for a dog or a carrier for a cat ready the day you are to bring the new pet home. Consider having your new pet bathed and groomed before you take it home.

Pet adoption is the process of taking responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or can no longer look after. If you are thinking about adopting a pet, here are some things to consider: *  Reason for Adoption: Think carefully about why you want to adopt a pet. Do you want a companion? Do you want a dog to run with you, or a cat to curl up beside you while you read? Are you willing to take time to care for a pet? *  Adoption Fee: Many shelters and rescue groups charge a fee to adopters. This fee often helps cover some of the cost of caring for the animals until they find homes. Ask about any required fees.

Here are some expenses to think about and here's how you can lower those costs, while ensuring your pet receives good care:          Required expenses:            -   Preventive, regular and emergency veterinary care: At a minimum, your pet will need to visit a veterinarian once a year to make sure it stays healthy. Some shelters may even offer low-cost spay/neuter and vaccinations.     -  Food and water: Your pet will need food and clean, fresh water. For large or medium-sized pets, you'll need to budget about $10-$50 per month for food and treats. Also, make sure you have food and water dishes.     -  Supplies: Make sure that you have everything your new pet will need--bed, collar, leash and training crate for a dog, scratching post for a cat, etc. So figure in about $50-$100, depending on what supplies you'll need at first.     -   Training and dog daycare: Puppy classes are essential to ensure your dog will be well socialized and trained. Adult dogs may need training classes to correct problem behaviors. You may also need to use a pet daycare and boarding facilities if you go on vacation or need to stay away from home because of an emergency.   -  Pet deposit (renters): Some landlords or rental companies require new tenants to pay a one-time, non-refundable deposit (aka pet deposit) for pets. The average pet deposit can be $300-$500, depending on where you live. In addition, some landlords also raise monthly rents by $20-$50 for tenants with pets.     -   Licensing: Many states and cities require that you license your pet, which usually costs about $10-$20.

A person experiences life events, such as childhood experiences, which can shape their personality and influence how creative they are. Creativity can also be influenced by a person's culture (beliefs, values, language, etc.). Creative people often look at life differently and see solutions that others do not. They may take risks when thinking in new ways and include original ideas and unusual elements in their work.   Creativity can be affected by a person's knowledge, habits, ways of thinking, and experience with learning, communicating, and solving problems. New experiences or ways of doing things help develop new neuron links (connections in the brain) or change the way links occur. This can help develop creativity. Even things that seem relatively simple, such as having a new routine or visiting a new place, can change the way the neurons connect and inspire creative thinking.\\n                    \\n                \\n                    Creativity can be enhanced with mental and physical activities.\\n                    \\n                    The brain needs exercise, just like any other part of the body. Doing mental and physical activities can help improve brain function and creativity. These activities strengthen neuron connections, increase blood circulation, oxygen, and nutrients to the brain, and help the brain work better and quicker in many different ways, including creativity. Brain-enhancing activities help form new connections between neurons, which can improve mental skills and creativity. These activities keep the brain healthy and improve skills that help everyday life.    Creativity-enhancing activities can include:             -  Sports and other physical exercise.    - Creative arts (writing, photography, music, theater, and fine arts).    -  Games and puzzles.    - Traveling and other new experiences.    -  Social activities that include interactions with different people.        It is important to take breaks from mental tasks. Breaks will rejuvenate the mind and boost creativity and problem-solving ability.   Mental activities that can improve brain function and creativity can improve thinking and attention skills, reasoning, learning, calculation skills, and judgment.

Remember to include occasional expenses check occasionally examine your assessment of importance.         \\n                \\n4. **Organize your spending into fixed and variable expenses.**         \\n     - *Fixed expenses* are the same each month, such as rent and student loan payments. You may be unable to reduce some fixed expenses, such as rent. But if there's something in this category you can change, consider moving to a less-expensive apartment or negotiating a salary raise.         \\n     -  *Variable expenses* may change from month to month, such as groceries. You may be able to reduce your variable expenses, such as by making a grocery list and sticking to it.        \\n     \\n5. **Create the budget.** Your budget should include both fixed and variable expenses. To see how much money you have to spend, try this:        \\n     - List your sources of income and how much money you have coming in. Include tips and babysitting money.         \\n     - List your fixed and variable expenses.         \\n     - Subtract your expenses from your income.

Think about what will work for you. Here are three types: \\n- **Traditional pen-and-paper budgets:** In this approach, you list your income and expenses on paper or in a spreadsheet, and track different types of expenses, like recurring or other expenses. You can also use planning and calendar apps with spending tracking functions.  \\n- **The 50/30/20 budget:** This is a budget that suggests spending on your needs, wants, and savings or debt repayment with 50%, 30%, and 20% of your income, respectively. \\n- **The envelope budgeting method:** This is an approach to budgeting, sometimes with real envelopes, where you make spending categories and put cash in envelopes with the spending limit for the category. If you run out of cash in that envelope during the month, you can't spend any more in that category! \\n\\n### What if I'm in debt?\\nBeing in debt can put a strain on finances, relationships, and emotional wellbeing. Yet, being aware of debt and being able to look at a budget with changes made for debt can help ease these burdens. \\n- Make a budget with your income and expenses. When you're estimating your expenses and gathering information about your debts, aim for paying at least the minimum amount each month. \\n- Estimate your debt payments. Use something like the Monthly Payment Calculator to get an estimate of how much to budget. \\n\\n### What if there is a difference between spending and budget?\\nIf your estimated spending differs from your budget, use what and how you spend that is different than what you had planned to help you learn how to adjust. Maybe your plan's assumptions were incorrect or with your situation complicated the budget plan just did not match reality as much as it should have. Keeping track of how close you are to your budget can help you learn to adjust budgets for account surprises and those that are complicated.\\n\\n### Make a plan\\nCreating a plan can help you get the most out of your new budget. Over time you may want to think about some of the items on this checklist. \\n- When creating your long-term budget, aim for a range of incomes and spending that are realistic to you. \\n- Set deadlines for both short-term and long-term budget goals. \\n- Anticipate changes and think how your daily habits can help you reach your budget goals. \\n-  Everyone's preferences and needs are different, so a budget should reflect yours!\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Creating a budget is an important skill that can help you manage your personal finances and make the best of your money.

Consider your financial goals, sources of income, monthly expenses, debts, savings, and your spending habits.  For tips on how to better understand your personal finances, see the Understanding Finances webpage. \\n\\n### Create a Budget\\nA budget is a plan for how to spend your money. When you track and manage your money, you might want to save, invest, buy goods and services, help others, and/or enjoy entertainment. You can do these things by following the steps in the next section. \\n\\n### 5 Steps to Create a Budget\\n1.  **Track your income**. Write down all the money you have coming in each month. This is your income. Be sure to include all sources of income, including your salary (take home pay), interest, dividends, rental income, child support, alimony, and so on.  *Tip: If your income is variable, use an average from the previous year or monthly income statements. *\\n    \\n2.  **Track your expenses**. Write down all your monthly expenses. This helps you see where your money goes. Through tracking your spending, you may find that you don't think about how much you spend on some things until you see the totals in writing. *Tip: Include fixed expenses (the same amount every month) such as utilities, mortgage or rent, property taxes, and insurance as well as variable expenses (change every month) such as groceries, gas, clothing, and entertainment.*\\n    \\n3.  **Set goals**. Decide what you want to achieve. You might want to build an emergency fund, reduce debt, or save up for a vacation, a car, or a home. *Tip: Set SMART goals. SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic, Trackable. For example, \\\"I want to save money for a car\\\" is a goal that is not SMART. A SMART goal would be \\\"I will put aside $200 a month for 8 months to save $1,600 for a used car.\\\"*\\n\\n4. **Develop a plan**. Using the information from your income, expenses and goals, create a plan to save, spend, and use your money. The example budget plan below can help you. *Tip: It may help to create spending categories for your budget, such as Housing (mortgage/rent), Transportation (car payments), Food (groceries) and Entertainment (movies). This can help you remember which expenses to include.*\\n    \\n5. **Put your plan into action**. Make sure you have the money to pay for what you want to buy. You can earn money and reduce spending.   For example, to earn money, you can sell things you don't use, complete other small tasks (like babysitting), and collect cans and bottles. To reduce spending, you might try to cut back on eating out, order smaller portions, or make your own meals instead.   *Tip:  Use a budget worksheet or online budgeting tool to track your income and expenses. Begin with your earlier totals, then update these totals as you enter new income and expense amounts.*\\n\\n\\n### Example Budget\\n(1) Track your monthly income.\\n   Use the table below to write down the total amount of all sources of income.\\n  \\n| Income  | Total  |\\n|---------|-------  |\\n| Job/Salary | $2,000  |\\n| Interest | $10     |\\n| Alimony | $200    |\\n|    |    |\\n|   Total   | $2,210 |\\n\\n\\n(2) Track your monthly expenses.\\n   Use the table below to write down the total amount of all expenses.\\n  \\n| Expense Type  | Total  |\\n|------------------|-------  |\\n| Housing               | $800   |\\n| Utilities               | $250   |\\n| Food                   | $300   |\\n| Transportation    | $200   |\\n| Personal              | $200    |\\n| Entertainment      | $300    |\\n|          |          |\\n|   Total             | $2,300 |\\n\\n\\n(3) Calculate the difference between the totals in the income and expense tables.\\n   Subtract the total expenses amount from the total income amount.\\n  \\n| Total Monthly Income  | Total Monthly Expenses  | Difference   |\\n|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|\\n| $2,210                     | $2,300                     | -$90      |\\n\\n\\n(4) Save and spend wisely based on the difference.\\n   Having a negative number means you spend more each month than you\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Budgeting can seem overwhelming at first but, with a little planning, and motivation, you can take control of your money.

Here are some of the most common:\\n                            \\n                            \\n                                50/30/20 budget - Divide your take-home pay into three categories:\\n                                    \\n                                    \\n                                          50% for needs  Needs include housing, food, insurance, transportation, and medicine.\\n                                          30% for wants  Wants include entertainment, vacations, eating out, and gifts. You do not need these things, but they make life more fun.\\n                                          20% for savings and debt repayment  Savings and debt repayment include savings for emergencies and retirement and paying off credit cards.\\n                                    \\n                                    \\n                                Zero-based budget - In this method, your income minus your expenses equals zero. Every dollar you earn is assigned a job. You start each month with your total income and create a list of your expenses. Once your expenses equal your income, you stop budgeting. This method ensures that you account for every dollar you spend.\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                Envelope system  Assign each category in your budget an envelope. Put cash in each envelope for expenses you will pay in cash, such as food and entertainment. When you spend the cash in each envelope, youre done spending in that category for the month. Using this system may help you see how much you have to spend and control overspending. This method also works if you use online bank accounts for various spending categories.\\n                                \\n                                \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            What is the right budgeting method for me?\\n                            The best way to budget is the way that works best for you. You may want to try different methods until you find one that fits your lifestyle. Start with one of the budgeting methods listed above. Budget monthly when expenses, such as rent and electricity, are due each month and weekly when expenses, such as food, entertainment, and transportation, vary each week.\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            How do I create a budget?\\n                            Follow these six steps to create a budget:\\n                            \\n                            \\n                                \\n                                1.

Include your net pay (the amount you take home after taxes and other deductions). Note: If your income varies each month, keep track of the average amount you earn each month over three months. To find the average, add the total amount for the three months and divide by three.\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                \\n                                2. Track your spending.\\n                                For one month, write down every time you spend money. You can track your spending with pen and paper, a spreadsheet, or an app. You can also save receipts or check your bank statements. Be sure to include everything you spend (from small to big amounts), such as:  Lunch on a special day  Grocery shopping  Gifts for others  Household items  Entertainment  Transportation costs  Write down your spending in these categories:  Housing  Utilities  Food  Transportation  Entertainment  Health  Personal  Children  Miscellaneous  Work  Total each category at the end of the month to see how much you spend in each category.\\n                                \\n                                \\n                                \\n                                3. Set savings and spending goals.\\n                                Look to the future and think about what you want. Goals should be SMART:   Specific: Use action words like buy, learn, and solve.

It takes time to set up and maintain, but the financial stability and awareness it brings can greatly enrich your life.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Creating a budget is a great way to take control of your finances. It helps you prioritize your spending according to your goals and manage your cash flow so you can save for the future. Here\u2019s how to create a budget in six steps.\\n\\n### Step 1: Write down your goals\\nThink about what you want your budget for. Your goals will influence your spending priorities and the budget categories you create. Your goals might include: \\n- **Paying off debt**: Scrutinize your monthly spending to find ways to cut expenses and allocate that money toward your debt.\\n- **Building an emergency fund**: This fund could start with a goal of $1,000, then gradually grow to cover 3 - 6 months' worth of living expenses.\\n- **Saving for a purchase**: If you\u2019re planning a major purchase such as a car or a vacation, you might choose to save for it rather than go into debt to buy it. \\n- **Saving for retirement**: Maximize contributions to retirement accounts, such as a company retirement plan or an individual retirement account (IRA).\\n- **Saving for education**: For children, consider a 529 college savings plan. For adults, save enough cash to pay for tuition in full, avoiding student loans.\\n\\n\\n### Step 2:  Track your spending\\nWith your goals in mind, track your spending for several weeks. Keep records of all of your expenses. Bank and credit card statements are a good place to start, but they may not show all your transactions. For example, you\u2019ll have to manually track the sum of your cash purchases, such as coffee and snacks throughout the month. If you want more information than you\u2019ll find in your statements, consider a personal finance app. \\n- Record your spending in categories, such as:\\n    - Housing\\n    - Utilities\\n    - Transportation\\n    - Food\\n    - Health\\n- Separate your spending into fixed and variable categories:\\n    - **Fixed expenses** are regular monthly bills that are the same amount each month. Examples include mortgage or rent payments, property taxes, utilities, and subscriptions.\\n    - **Variable expenses** occur each month, but the total varies. Examples include groceries, entertainment, and dining out.\\n\\n### Step 3: Set up the budget\\nAfter you gather three months of spending data for each category, calculate a monthly average. You can use a pen and paper, a spreadsheet, or a budgeting app. (See Step 4 for commonsense tips.) \\n- Subtract total expenses from total income. This is your discretionary income.\\n-  Create a budget with: \\n     -  your financial goals, \\n     - each of the income sources and expense categories you tracked, and \\n     -\u00a0 the details of your finances (bank and debt balances, due dates, etc.) \\n\\n\\n### Step 4: Choose a budgeting plan\\nA good budgeting plan can help you allocate your money based on your income. Here are four common plans: \\n- **Pay yourself first**: Once you get paid, set aside money for your goals, such as an emergency fund or retirement. Then, pay your fixed expenses and spend what\u2019s left however you want. \\n    - *Best for*: Those with steady income who want to prioritize savings.\\n- **50/30/20**: Allocate 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment.\\n    - *Best for*: Those who want a simple way to manage their discretionary income.\\n- **Envelope system**: Set aside cash for each expense category by placing money in envelopes. When the envelope is empty, you can\u2019t spend any more in that category. \\n    - *Best for*: People for whom it\u2019s hard to stay within their spending limits, or who manage their money better with cash than with credit.\\n- **Percentage-based**: Spend half your income on fixed expenses, one-third on variable expenses, and one-sixth on savings and debt repayment.\\n    - *Best for*: Beginners who want a simple plan.\\n\\n\\n### Step 5: Manage your budget\\nAfter you\u2019ve created and implemented a budget, find ways to track how well you\u2019re following it. \\n- To review your budget regularly:\\n    - Set aside time each month to make adjustments.\\n    - Create a monthly budget report that compares budgeted amounts to actual amounts for each category.\\n    - At the end of each month, ask yourself:\\n        - Was I able to stick to my budget?\\n        - Did I meet my financial goals?\\n        - What changes should I make next month? \\n- Adjust your budget as your income, expenses, and goals change.\\n- Consider creating a report card to assess how well you stick to your budget. \\n\\n### Step 6: Adjust your budget\\nAt the end of each month, follow up with the new theory that applies to budget planning: \\\"What gets measured gets managed\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Creating a budget involves several steps that can help you understand your finances and plan your spending.

{"prompt": "How do I get better at chess What should I know?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Improvement in chess comes through a combination of study and practice. The following advice outlines several important aspects of chess and chess improvement. Remember that enjoyment of the game is also an important component of improvement. Play lots of chess, and enjoy the process of getting better!\\n\\n### Essential Advice\\n1. **Play Chess Regularly**: The best way to get better is to play a lot and have fun. All players take a bit of time to get better, but playing regularly ensures you are improving consistently. Online play makes playing regularly easy.\\n2. **Play Longer Time Controls**: When you are thinking through every aspect of a move, at least 30 minutes (preferably more), you have to think carefully about everything you know. You will practice thinking carefully about all aspects of chess, and you will retain what you learn better. Imagine how much better at playing chess you would be if you had an extra hour for every game! It is tempting to play blitz and bullet chess at first, since the games are short. But you will be improving more if you play longer games instead.\\n3. **Ponder the Most Famous Chess Games**: Look up the most famous games ever played, and think about them. You will learn many things by thinking about chess played at its highest level.\\n4. **Find Good Lessons on YouTube**: Many chess players are very skilled at imparting what they know through video. Spend some time browsing YouTube for chess videos, or see below for a list of engaging channels.\\n\\n### More Ways to Improve Your Chess\\n1. **Analyze Your Own Games**: If you use an online server to play, have the server analyze your game for you (usually a premium feature). If you do not use an online server for this, be sure to have a chess engine analyze your game afterwards. Learn from the strengths and weaknesses of your play.\\n2. **Play Against Stronger Players**: This can be frustrating, but it is an excellent way to improve. You will have to think through each move and be brave enough to shrug off mistakes. It's good practice to try your best against stronger players, especially since they don't all play perfectly either!\\n3. **Participate in a Chess Club or Online Community**: Whether real-life or online, it is helpful to enjoy chess with others who like it too. You will have additional opportunities for chess improvement and may even become friends with other chess players.\\n4. **Study the Endgame**: Just like new drivers meet with a scary amount of accidents, new chess players lose a lot of games at the end, especially the endgame! The basics of structured play can help even complete newcomers win.\\n\\n### Further Chess Study\\n1. **Use a Chess Engine**: Many devices allow a chess player to plug their standards into a computer. While this is not always a good idea, here are a few ideas to think about if you want to use one: Consider the standards a chess engine suggests as instructions for how it would play the game if it experienced no suffering. Do not assume that your play matches its suggestions! Sometimes, what a chess engine considers a good play does not have anything to do with your understanding of the game. Chess engines sometimes assess a position incorrectly, so do not take everything they suggest or agree with. It's often best to consider the results of a chess engine's analysis as one way of looking at a game, rather than always the best.\\n2. **Try Different Versions**: Chess is a game with many variations. If you find chess too challenging, try backgammon, dominoes, checkers, or a different version of chess. Retro games can also improve your ability to strategize.\\n3. **Use Chess Puzzles and Tactics**: Chess-themed puzzles can reveal certain elements of what makes a move enjoyable. Considering these few specific moves can bring a lot of delight, because they clarify which move to play, even in a tense situation.\\n\\n### Recommended Channels for Learning Chess\\nAt the bottom of each of these channels, note how many players subscribe. (The number of subscribers tends to indicate how useful or enjoyable a channel is.) Keep in mind, though, that there are always new chess champions and new members to any chess community. Every year of chess contains new events.\\n1. **Madis mouse** - 2200+ puzzles - the most renowned in chess. Check below for many sub-channels!\\n2. **Learn Chess With Lisa** - an incredibly useful repository of lessons delivered with a personal touch.\\n3. **GothamChess** - a channel run by experienced players that often references community standards for engagement.

Learn from your mistakes. \\n\\n3. **Study the Endgames:** Many players overlook the endgame phase in chess. Without an endgame plan in mind, you may lose the game. \\n\\n4. **Learn Openings:** Avoid memorizing many move sequences for different openings. Instead, try to understand key ideas behind each opening focus on controlling the center, developing pieces, and promptly castling. \\n\\n5. **Study Tactics:** The quickest way to a win is by finding clever tactics or traps and your opponent may also create tactics to capture your pieces. Practice tactics puzzles to improve your skills. \\n\\n6. **Play Puzzle Rush:** A time challenge that rewards bottom players more points for complete puzzles faster. It quickly improves tactical skills if you play it often. \\n\\n7. **Play Regularly:** In the beginning, have one or two regular times each week to play chess. You will learn from experience that way.\\n\\n### Things to Know\\n1. **Opening Moves:** At the start of the game, move pieces towards the center of the board and develop them instead of moving the same piece many times. Center pawns and minor pieces should be the first developed. \\n\\n2. **Strong Pawn Structure:** Pawns do not move backward and if you lose one, it is gone. Therefore, develop a strong pawn structure with good square controls. \\n\\n3. **Winning Material:** The quickest way to get an advantage over your opponent is to take their pieces. Try to trade your lesser pieces for their more powerful pieces. But be careful not to lose your pieces in the process! \\n\\n4. **Short and Long-term Goals:** Determine what you want to work on as you improve at chess. Are there specific openings you want to learn? Or maybe you want to learn the most important endgame moves?

Online platforms offer the chance to play with people from around the world.\\n\\n2. **Study Openings**: Learn the basic principles of chess openings, such as controlling the center, developing pieces, and ensuring the safety of your king.

Use tactics trainer tools available on chess websites, or work through books that focus on tactical puzzles.\\n\\n4. **Learn Basic Endgames**: Knowing how to convert a material advantage into a win is crucial. Start with basic endgames like king and pawn versus king, and work up to more complex ones.\\n\\n5. **Study Master Games**: Watch games played by strong players.

This is especially important for games you lost. Use a chess engine to help identify blunders, but be sure to understand why the mistakes were bad moves.\\n\\n7. **Learn Strategic Concepts**: In addition to tactics, understand important strategic ideas such as controlling open files, the importance of pawn structure, and how to create weaknesses in your opponent's position.\\n\\n8. **Play Different Time Controls**: Rapid, blitz, and long games all have their merits. Quick games help you practice tactics and openings, while longer games force you to think deeply about your moves and strategies.\\n\\n9. **Join a Chess Club**: Find a local chess club or community where you can play regularly with others.

Active listening\\nActive listening means listening to understand what is being said, rather than just waiting for your turn to talk. You can develop this skill by taking time to listen to people around you every day. You might try to listen without forming an opinion, giving advice, or thinking about what to say next while the other person speaks. By practicing active listening with others, you\u2019ll also learn how to pay attention to feedback and body language when you\u2019re the one speaking.\\n\\n\\n### 2. Empathy\\nEmpathy is the ability to understand and share another person\u2019s feelings. Speaking from a place of empathy means that you get to know your audience and create an emotional connection with them through your message.

Whether you want to play folk songs around a campfire, strum your favorite pop tunes, or shred like a heavy metal guitar god, the guitar is a great instrument to learn.\\n\\n___\\nWhat are the different types of guitars?\\n___\\n\\n\\nThere are many kinds of guitars. They are generally divided into two groups: **acoustic** and **electric**. Within those two groups, there are many different kinds of acoustic and electric guitars. Here are a few of the most common types:\\n\\n_______\\n**Acoustic Guitar** \\nAn acoustic guitar is a guitar that does not need an amplifier. Acoustic guitars have hollow bodies that resonate (vibrate) to make sound. Acoustic guitars can be divided into two types:     -  **Steel-string guitars**, typically used for country, folk, rock, blues, and popular music. The sound of a steel-string guitar is bright and sharp.     -  **Classical guitars**, typically used for classical music and flamenco. These guitars have softer nylon strings that are usually made of nylon (as opposed to wire).\\n_______\\n\\n\\n_______\\n**Electric Guitar** \\nElectric guitars use electromagnetic pickups to convert the vibration of the strings into electrical signals that are sent to an amplifier. Electric guitars come in many shapes and sizes. Most of them, though, are solid-bodied guitars like the Fender Telecaster or the Gibson Les Paul. To hear solid-bodied electric guitars, listen to rock bands from the late 20th century and heavy metal bands from the 1980s.\\n_______\\n\\n\\n_______\\n**Hollow-bodied Guitar** \\nHollow-bodied guitars use large, hollow bodies to make them resonate at a frequency. Most of these guitars look like traditional acoustic guitars but have guitars with either single coils or humbucking pickups. These guitars are commonly used for a variety of music, including jazz, country, or blues.\\n_______\\n\\n\\n___\\nWhat should I do before I start learning to play?\\n___\\n\\n- ***Choose a guitar.*** If you are starting to learn guitar, you may want to start with either an acoustic guitar or a basic electric guitar. Both are good for beginners.   - If you have never played guitar before, find a guitar teacher or someone to guide you in choosing a guitar. Having the right guitar is important for your comfort, and learning on the wrong type of guitar can make playing frustrating. Compared to a standard guitar, a child-size guitar can help kids with small hands learn and grow. A child-size guitar has a shorter neck than a standard guitar, making it easier for small hands to play chords.   - Acoustic guitars are often less expensive than electric guitars, and they do not need amplifiers or other equipment. If you buy an electric guitar, you will probably also need to budget for buying an amplifier.   - Acoustic steel-string guitars are usually tuned a half-step lower than standard guitars, which means they have a lower pitch.   - If you are learning to play classical music, choose a classical guitar. Classical guitars have wooden bodies without any artificial materials, and there are many different styles of classical guitars.   - If you are left-handed, find a left-handed guitar. Some brands make left-handed guitars, but be careful: some brands don't and treat their left-handed guitars like right-handed guitars. Choices of left-handed guitars may be limited. Acoustic left-handed guitars have a typical two-octave fretboard.   - Consider your budget. Sometimes spending more will save you money. If you can afford it, consider buying a brands brand guitar. Many left-handed guitars are made for one-handed use, though most brands have some left-handed offerings that break this rule. Brands include:       - Baker Guitars          - Erikson          - ESP Guitars      Electric guitars range from beginner models that sound cheap to expensive models that sound great and will stay in tune for a long time. Cheaper guitars do not always feel as good to play, and an expensive guitar can be hard to find. So, it is best to try out a few guitars before you decide on one.   - If you play a different instrument, budget for $30 to $100 per month to build your skills. You may want to invest a little more at first, as you will need lessons, books, and practice for a while until you are skilled.   - If you could borrow a guitar from a friend, see if you could borrow one first and try it out for a while to see how it feels. If you are thinking about getting a friend to give you an expensive guitar as a present, you should probably get the more expensive one first because these guitars almost always stay in tune and sound great.     ___     ***Join a\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Learning to play the guitar is an exciting journey that involves developing both practical skills and musical knowledge.

Before you begin, it may be helpful to know a little about how to play guitar. Be sure to study an overview of basic guitar information to see if it's right for you. This will help you understand the equipment you will need and the practice you will have to put in to fully enjoy the guitar. An overview of basic history, design, strategy and techniques is included below.\\n\\n### Understanding Basic Guitar Information\\nThis section discusses basic information about the history and types of guitars as well as how they work.\\n\\n#### History of the Guitar\\nThe guitar has an ancient history that goes back about 4000 years. The earliest known stringed instruments are the lyres and harps of ancient Iran. The guitar is most likely an offshoot of the lute, which was brought to Spain by the Moors in the seventh century. Other stringed instruments that influenced the modern guitar include the cantiga, vihuela, and other early guitars.\\n\\n#### Guitar Design\\nThe modern guitar has six strings that usually are made of a metal core and a nylon or metal winding. These are attached to a wooden body that keeps the sound from echoing into a solid, dull, or sharp tone. Most guitars have two types of strings. The E string is tuned down to an E note. The A string is tuned down to an A note. The D string is tuned down to a D note. The G string is tuned down to a G note. The two highest note strings, B and E, are both tuned down to an E note. This combination of notes makes the most common sound.\\n\\n#### Types of Guitars\\nMusical instrument makers build guitars to play different styles and to play different kinds of music.\\n\\nThe two most common types of guitars are acoustic and electric. An acoustic guitar has a hollow wooden body and sounds better when amplified by a microphone. An electric guitar has an electric amplifier or speakers that carry along sound. Like other woodwind and brass instruments, an electric guitar will not work well without a high-quality instrument. Many musicians begin with an acoustic guitar so they can hear each note clearly. Once they have learned to play chords and understand the basic lovin and rhythm of music, they often pick up an electric guitar.\\n\\n#### The Components of a Guitar\\nThere are many different \\\"parts\\\" that work together to make a guitar.\\n\\n   - **Headstock**: The part of a guitar string that goes up at a right angle to the top of the body.\\n   - **Body shape**: The body shape of the guitar determines which way you should tune the strings for your best sound.\\n   - **Body wood**: Guitar bodies are usually made of three pieces of wood sandwiched together. The type and amount of glue used also affects the sound.\\n   - **Bridge**: The center piece of wood that keeps vibrations going through the sides of the bridge to the body.\\n   - **Bridge height**: This is the height of the top of the neck from the strings to the center of the guitar top.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Practical Skills\\nThis section lists particular skills you need to learn to play guitar effectively.\\n\\n    - How to pick or strum a guitar string\\n    - How to play arpeggios\\n    - How to create guitar strains\\n    - How to play one note or several notes at a time\\n    - How to arrange guitar chords into four, six, or eight note songs\\n    - How to play in different rhythms\\n\\n\\n\\n### Setting up Equipment\\nBefore your first lesson or practice session, you will want to get some basic equipment ready.\\n\\n    - **Guitars**: Brands, types, and sounds vary. Acoustics are often made by Steinway, while an electric guitar often is like a Baldwin.\\n    - **Strings**: Strings also come in different materials, thicknesses, and tensions. Some electric guitars work better with nylon strings.\\n    - **Cases/Radios**: For acoustic guitars, getting a good mic might be wise, unless you want to wrap tape around the body.\\n    - **Metronome**: This gadget helps you change speeds while still keeping on tempo. Some metronome novices do not know how to keep on product rhythm.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Learning to Play\\nThe most effective way to learn to play guitar is to work with a teacher. However, many teachers simply tell you to practice on your own. There are different ways to learn! Having fun is important if you want to love soccer. You will want to try new cards of music, check out local bands or festivals, or walk along with other musicians. There are many ways to make great music! If you learn better in groups like Boy's Evenings, you can check out events near you.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Here are some tips for each step, along with a basic recipe:\\n\\n### Tips for Sourdough Bread:\\n1. **Starter Care**:\\n   - Use a mature starter: Make sure your sourdough starter is active and bubbly.\\n   - Feed your starter: Maintain a consistent feeding schedule if you keep it at room temperature or refrigerate it (feed it once a week for the latter).\\n\\n2. **Tools**:\\n   - Use a kitchen scale for accurate measurements (flour and water can be difficult to measure precisely by volume).\\n   - A Dutch oven or baking stone help create steam, resulting in a crispy crust.\\n\\n3. **Autolyse**:\\n   - Allow flour and water to rest before adding salt and starter to enhance gluten development.\\n\\n4. **Stretch and Fold**:\\n   - Instead of kneading, use stretch and fold techniques during bulk fermentation to build dough strength.\\n\\n5. **Shaping**:\\n   - Use a light touch when shaping: Minimizing gas loss helps create a light, airy loaf.\\n\\n6. **Preheat Thoroughly**:\\n   - Ensure the Dutch oven or baking stone is thoroughly preheated to create a good oven spring.\\n\\n### Basic Sourdough Bread Recipe\\n\\n#### Ingredients:\\n- 1 cup (240g) active sourdough starter\\n- 1 1/2 cups (360ml) water at room temperature\\n- 4 cups (480g) bread flour\\n- 1 cup (120g) whole wheat flour\\n- 1 1/2 tsp (9g) salt\\n\\n#### Instructions:\\n1. **Mix**:\\n   - In a large bowl, mix the starter, water, bread flour, and whole wheat flour until no dry bits remain. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes (autolyse).\\n\\n2. **Add Salt**:\\n   - Sprinkle salt over the dough and add a little more water if needed. Mix with your hands by pinching and folding until incorporated.\\n\\n3. **Bulk Fermentation**:\\n   - Let the dough rest at room temperature for 4-6 hours until it has risen noticeably. During the first 2 hours, perform 4 sets of stretch and folds: With wet hands, pull one side of the dough up and fold it over the center; turn the bowl and repeat until you've stretched and folded each side.\\n\\n4. **Pre-shape**:\\n   - Lightly flour the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape it into a loose ball. Let it rest for 20-30 minutes.\\n\\n5. **Shape**:\\n   - For a round loaf: Gently flatten the dough, tuck the edges into the center, then flip it over seam-side down. Use your hands to shape it into a tighter ball. For an oval loaf, shape it into an oval. \\n\\n6. **Final Proof**:\\n   - Place the shaped dough seam-side up in a well-floured proofing basket (banneton) or bowl. Cover with a cloth and let it rise for about 1-2 hours at room temperature, or in the refrigerator overnight.\\n\\n7. **Preheat Oven**:\\n   - Place a Dutch oven in the oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C) for at least 30 minutes.\\n\\n8. **Score and Bake**:\\n   - If you intend to bake the dough straight from the fridge, take your dough out while the oven preheats. Once preheated, carefully remove the Dutch oven. Turn the dough out onto parchment paper, score the top with a sharp knife or razor blade, and lift it into the pot using the parchment as a sling.\\n   - Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 15-30 minutes until deep brown.\\n\\n9. **Cool**:\\n   - Remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. This allows the interior to set properly.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nSourdough bread making is as much an art as it is a science, and the more you practice, the better your bread will become!

Here's a basic process to guide you through: \\n\\n### 1. Gather Your Ingredients.\\nYou will need:\\n- **Flour**: All-purpose, whole wheat, and bread flour work well.\\n- **Water**: Preferably room temperature or slightly warm.\\n- **Salt**: Sea salt or kosher salt.\\n- **Sourdough starter**: This is crucial. It contains wild yeast and bacteria that ferment the dough.\\n\\n### 2. Feed Your Starter.\\nIf your starter has been in the fridge, take it out and feed it (add equal weights of flour and water) 8-12 hours before you plan to make the dough so that it becomes bubbly and active.\\n\\n### 3. Autolyse the Dough. \\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour and water (hold off on adding salt for now) until there are no dry bits of flour. Let your mixture sit for 30 minutes to an hour. This step helps with gluten development.\\n\\n### 4. Mix in Salt & Starter. \\nAfter the autolyse, add your active starter and salt to the dough. Mix until well incorporated.\\n\\n### 5. Bulk Fermentation. \\nAt room temperature (about 70-75\u00b0F or 21-24\u00b0C), let the dough rise for 4-5 hours. Over the first two hours, stretch and fold the dough every 30 minutes. After two hours, let it rest undisturbed.\\n\\n### 6. Pre-shape the Dough. \\nFlour your work surface, turn the dough out, and shape it into a ball or rectangle as appropriate. Let it rest for 30 minutes.\\n\\n### 7. Shape the Dough. \\nAfter the rest, shape the dough again into a tight ball or batard (oval). Use a bench scraper and your hands. This helps create surface tension.\\n\\n### 8. Proof the Dough. \\nPlace the dough into a floured proofing basket, seam side up. Cover and let it rise 1-4 hours at room temperature or refrigerate it overnight for more flavor.\\n\\n### 9. Preheat Your Oven. \\nIf you\u2019re using a baking stone, place it in the oven. Put a Dutch oven or a heavy-duty baking sheet in the oven to preheat at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). \\n\\n### 10. Score & Bake the Bread. \\nOnce the dough is ready, carefully turn it out onto parchment paper, score the top with a blade, and transfer it to the hot Dutch oven or baking stone. Bake covered for 30 minutes to 1 hour, then remove the lid or stop the baking stone to allow the crust to brown.\\n\\n### 11. Cool the Bread. \\nAfter baking, use tongs to move the loaves (still on the parchment paper) to a wire rack. Let the bread cool completely before slicing to finish the process.\\n\\n### Tips:\\n- **Experiment with Flour Combinations**: Different flours (whole wheat, spelt) can add flavor.\\n- **Use the \u201cWindowpane Test\u201d for Gluten Development**: Stretch a small piece of dough; if it doesn't break and you can see light through it, it's ready! \\n- **Be Patient**: It may take time to get everything just right, so don't be discouraged!\\n- **Taste as You Go!**: Always taste your bread warm from the oven with butter!\\n\\nEnjoy the journey of sourdough bread baking!\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Making sourdough bread is a rewarding process that involves cultivating natural yeast and bacteria in dough.

This is called the autolyse stage and helps with gluten development.\\n\\n### 3. Stretch and Fold\\n\\n- After the autolyse, perform a series of stretch and folds. Wet your hands to prevent sticking, grab one side of the dough, stretch it gently upwards, and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat until you've stretched and folded all sides of the dough.\\n- Cover the dough and let it rise at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours, performing stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours.\\n\\n### 4. Pre-shape the Dough\\n\\n- After the bulk fermentation, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a bench scraper to divide the dough into two equal pieces. Let them rest, covered, for about 20-30 minutes.\\n\\n### 5. Shape the Dough\\n\\n- After the resting period, shape each piece of dough into a tight round or oval loaf. Use your hands to create tension on the surface of the dough by gently pushing it against the unfloured surface.\\n\\n### 6. Prepare for Baking\\n\\n- Place the shaped loaves into well-floured proofing baskets with the seam side up (or down if you prefer).\\n- Cover the loaves with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let them proof for 1 to 3 hours at room temperature, or in the fridge overnight for a longer fermentation.\\n\\n### 7. Preheat the Oven\\n\\n- About 30 minutes before baking, place a Dutch oven or baking stone in the oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C).\\n\\n### 8. Bake the Bread\\n\\n- Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven. Turn the proofed bread out onto parchment paper, score the top with a sharp knife or blade, and lift it using the parchment paper into the Dutch oven. Cover with the lid (if using a Dutch oven) and bake for 30 minutes.\\n- After 30 minutes, remove the lid (if using a Dutch oven) and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is deeply golden brown and the internal temperature of the bread registers at least 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C).\\n  \\n### 9. Cool and Enjoy!\\n\\n- Once baked, remove the bread from the Dutch oven or baking stone and place it on a wire rack to cool completely. Sourdough bread can be enjoyed as is or used for sandwiches, toast, or more!\\n\\nMaking sourdough bread can take some practice, but the process is very rewarding!

Making sourdough bread is a rewarding process that not only results in delicious bread but also connects you to an age-old baking tradition. Here's a breakdown of the process, equipment, and basic recipe to help you understand how sourdough bread is made.\\n\\n### What is Sourdough Bread?\\nSourdough bread is made through the process of fermentation, which occurs when wild yeast and bacteria (lactic acid bacteria) present in the environment or in a sourdough starter break down the sugars in the dough. This fermentation process gives sourdough its distinctive tangy flavor and chewy texture.\\n\\n### What You'll Need\\n- **Sourdough Starter:** A mixture of flour and water that has fermented over several days to cultivate wild yeast and bacteria. You can buy one or make your own.\\n- **Ingredients:**\\n  - Bread flour (or a mix of bread flour and whole wheat flour)\\n  - Water (preferably filtered or dechlorinated)\\n  - Salt\\n- **Equipment:**\\n  - Mixing bowl\\n  - Dough scraper\\n  - Bench knife (optional)\\n  - Kitchen scale (for accurate measurement)\\n  - Banneton or bowl for proofing\\n  - Baking stone or Dutch oven (for baking)\\n  - Parchment paper (optional)\\n\\n### Making Sourdough Bread (Basic Overview)\\n1. **Feed Your Starter:** Ensure your sourdough starter is active by feeding it with equal weights of flour and water. Wait for it to become bubbly and double in size.\\n  \\n2. **Autolyse:**  Mix flour and water together in a bowl and let it rest for about 30 minutes to an hour. This helps to hydrate the flour and begin gluten development.\\n\\n3. **Mixing:**  After the autolyse, add salt and a portion of your active starter. Combine until there are no dry bits of flour left.\\n\\n4. **Bulk Fermentation:** Cover the dough and let it rest at room temperature for several hours. During this time, perform a series of stretch and folds every 30-60 minutes to develop the dough's strength. The dough should increase in size by about 25% and show bubbles on the surface.\\n\\n5. **Pre-shape:** Once the bulk fermentation is complete, gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a bench knife to divide the dough into loaves. Pre-shape each piece into a round, cover with a towel, and let rest for 20-30 minutes.\\n\\n6. **Final Shape:** Shape each piece of dough into its final form, such as a round or oblong loaf. Place shaped dough into a floured banneton or bowl for the final rise.\\n\\n7. **Proofing:** Allow the dough to rise again for several hours at room temperature. Alternatively, you can retard the dough in the refrigerator overnight, which will deepen the flavor.\\n\\n8. **Preheat Oven:** If you're baking immediately, preheat your oven to around 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C) with a baking stone or Dutch oven inside.\\n\\n9. **Scoring and Baking:** If the dough has been refrigerated, remove it and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour. When ready, carefully turn the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper if necessary, then score the top with a razor or sharp knife. Transfer the loaf into the preheated Dutch oven or onto the baking stone. Bake for 30-45 minutes, or until the crust is deep brown and the internal temperature of the bread is about 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C).\\n\\n10. **Cool and Enjoy:**  Once baked, let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. The cooling process allows the crumb to set properly.\\n\\n### Tips for Success\\n- **Climate and Timing:**  Fermentation times vary depending on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen.\\n- **Hydration Levels:** You can experiment with the amount of water in your recipe to create different textures. Higher hydration doughs are stickier but can develop a beautiful open crumb.\\n- **Practice:** It may take a few tries to get the desired crust and crumb texture. Don't be discouraged!\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nSourdough bread is a labor of love and requires patience and observation. As you gain experience, you'll learn more about handling the dough and developing flavors.

Instead of using commercial yeast for leavening, sourdough relies on a \\\"starter,\\\" a mixture of flour and water that has been cultivated with wild yeast and bacteria. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to make sourdough bread:\\n\\n### Step 1: Make or Obtain a Sourdough Starter\\nTo start, you need a sourdough starter. You can either obtain one from a friend or a bakery, or you can make your own by following these basic steps:\\n\\n1. **Mix Flour and Water**: Combine equal parts (by weight) of all-purpose or whole grain flour and water in a clean container. For example, start with 120 grams (1/2 cup) of each.\\n2. **Let it Sit**: Cover the container loosely (to allow gas to escape) and let it sit at room temperature (around 21-24\u00b0C or 70-75\u00b0F) for 24 hours.\\n3. **Feed the Starter**: Discard half of the mixture, and then feed it by adding the same amount of flour and water as before. Repeat this process every day.\\n4. **Watch for Bubbles**: Over the course of about a week, you should see bubbles forming as the wild yeast and bacteria become active. The mixture will also start to smell tangy.\\n5. **Raising Power**: When your mixture doubles in volume within about 4-6 hours of feeding and has a pleasant, slightly sour smell, it's ready to use as a starter.\\n\\n### Step 2: Prepare the Dough\\n1. **Gather Ingredients**:\\n   - 500 g (4 cups) bread flour\\n   - 350 g (1.5 cups) water, at room temperature\\n   - 100 g (1/2 cup) active sourdough starter, fed and bubbly\\n   - 10 g (2 tsp) salt\\n\\n2. **Mix Ingredients**:\\n   - In a large bowl, combine the flour and most of the water (reserve about 50 g). Mix until no dry flour remains. The mixture will be shaggy and sticky.\\n   - Add the sourdough starter and the reserved water. Mix until well combined.\\n   - Sprinkle salt on top of the dough and mix it in by pinching the dough between your fingers to incorporate.\\n\\n3. **Autolyse**: Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. This allows the flour to absorb water, which makes it easier to shape later.\\n\\n### Step 3: Bulk Fermentation\\n1. **Ferment**: Cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for about 4 to 6 hours, or until it has grown in size and looks puffy. The timing will depend on the temperature of your kitchen and the strength of your starter.\\n\\n2. **Fold the Dough**: During the first 2 hours of bulk fermentation, do a series of \\\"stretch and folds.\\\" Every 30 minutes, wet your hands to prevent sticking, then gently stretch one side of the dough upward and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat until you've stretched and folded each side. This helps develop the dough's strength.\\n\\n### Step 4: Shape and Proof\\n1. **Pre-shape**: Lightly flour your work surface and turn out the dough onto it. Gently flatten the dough into a rectangle, then fold the edges towards the center. Flip the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover it and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.\\n\\n2. **Final Shape**: After resting, shape the dough again into a round or oval, depending on your proofing basket shape. Create tension on the surface of the dough by gently pulling it towards you. Use a bench scraper to help. Place the shaped dough seam side up in a well-floured proofing basket or bowl.\\n\\n3. **Proof**: Cover the dough and let it proof for another 1-2 hours at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge for a colder, longer fermentation (this improves flavor).\\n\\n### Step 5: Bake the Bread\\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Place a Dutch oven or baking stone in the oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for about 30 minutes.\\n\\n2. **Score the Bread**: When the oven is ready, carefully remove the Dutch oven (use oven mitts!). If proofing in the fridge, take the dough out and flip it onto a piece of parchment paper. Use a sharp knife or blade to score the top of the loaf.\\n\\n3. **Bake**: Carefully lift the dough with the parchment and place it into the hot Dutch oven.

Add the salt and knead until the dough is smooth.\\n\\n4. **1st Rise**: Put the dough in a lightly greased large bowl and cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let it rise until doubled in volume, about 4 hours.\\n\\n5. **Shape the Dough**: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it in half. With a floured rolling pin, roll out each half into a rectangle. Start with the long side facing you, and roll the dough into a tight cylinder, pinching the seam to close it. Tuck the ends of the dough under so that the dough is a smooth ball or oval shape. (You can also make round loaves.)\\n\\n6. **2nd Rise**: Put the loaves, seam side down, in floured proofing baskets (the baskets will leave pretty spiral patterns on the loaves). If you don\u2019t have proofing baskets, use a bowl lined with flour-dusted kitchen towels. Cover the loaves loosely with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let rise until they double in volume, about 2 hours. For the best flavor, let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator instead. This also makes it easier to shape the loaves.\\n\\n7. **Heat Oven**: About 45 minutes before you\u2019re ready to bake, place a baking stone in the oven if you have one, or put an overturned baking sheet in the oven (this is where the loaves will bake). Heat the oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C).\\n\\n8. **Score the Loaves**: When the loaves are ready to bake, use a sharp knife or a lame to gently score the tops in an 'X' or a spiral pattern.\\n\\n9. **Bake the Loaves**: Carefully slide the loaves onto the baking stone or overturned baking sheet. Use a spray bottle to spray the walls of the oven with water to create steam. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped, 25 to 35 minutes. Check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer; they should be about 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C). Let cool on wire racks.\\n\\n## Tips\\n- Make sure that your starter is active when you make the dough.\\n- If your house is cool, you may need to let the dough rise longer than directed.\\n- Adjust the baking time and temperature until you find the right combination for your oven.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Making sourdough bread is a rewarding process! Sourdough bread relies on natural fermentation to rise, which gives it its distinctive flavor. Here\u2019s a simple recipe to guide you through making a basic sourdough loaf. Before you start, ensure you have an active sourdough starter, which is the key to successful sourdough bread. \\n\\n### Equipment Needed\\n- Mixing bowl\\n- Dough scraper\\n- Kitchen scale (optional but recommended)\\n- Dutch oven or baking stone\\n- Parchment paper\\n- Cooling rack\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n- **For the leaven**:\\n  - 50g (1/4 cup) ripe sourdough starter\\n  - 200g (about 1 cup) warm water (about 80\u00b0F or 27\u00b0C)\\n  - 100g (3/4 cup) all-purpose flour\\n  - 100g (3/4 cup) whole wheat flour\\n\\n- **For the dough**:\\n  - 500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour\\n  - 250g (1 cup) warm water (about 80\u00b0F or 27\u00b0C)\\n  - 10g (2 tsp) salt\\n  - Entire leaven from above\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n#### 1. Prepare the Leaven\\n- **Night Before**: Mix the ripe sourdough starter with water and flours in a bowl until well combined. Cover and let it sit at room temperature overnight. It should become bubbly and expand.\\n\\n#### 2. Autolyse\\n- In a large bowl, mix the 500g flour with 250g warm water and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This process helps the flour absorb the water and gluten develop.\\n\\n#### 3. Mix the Dough\\n- After the autolyse, add the leaven and 10g salt to the dough. Mix with your hands by pinching and folding the dough until the salt and leaven are fully incorporated.\\n\\n#### 4. Bulk Fermentation\\n- Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let the dough rise at room temperature for about 4-5 hours. Every 30 minutes during the first 2 hours, perform a series of stretch and folds: wet your hands, grab the edge of the dough, and stretch it up and over itself. Repeat until you've gone around the bowl.\\n\\n#### 5. Pre-shape\\n- After bulk fermentation, turn the dough onto a floured surface and divide it into two portions (for two loaves). Pre-shape each portion into a round. Cover and let it rest for about 30 minutes.\\n\\n#### 6. Final Shape\\n- After resting, shape each portion into a tighter ball or oval by folding the edges into the center. Flip it seam-side down and use your hands to cup and rotate the dough against the counter to create tension on the surface.\\n\\n#### 7. Proof\\n- Place shaped dough seam-side up in a floured proofing basket or bowl. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Let them proof for 1-2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge for more flavor.\\n\\n#### 8. Preheat Oven\\n- If proofing at room temperature: Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C) about 30 minutes before baking. If using a Dutch oven, place it inside the oven to preheat.\\n  \\n#### 9. Score and Bake\\n- Carefully turn the dough out onto parchment paper (if using a Dutch oven). Use a sharp knife or razor blade to score the top of the loaf. Place it inside the hot Dutch oven. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the crust is deeply golden brown.\\n\\n#### 10. Cool\\n- Once baked, transfer the bread to a cooling rack. Allow it to cool completely for at least an hour before slicing.\\n\\n### Tips\\n- **Hydration**: This recipe is fairly high hydration (more water), which can be sticky. You can reduce the water slightly if needed.\\n- **Flavor Development**: Allowing the dough to rise slowly in the fridge (cold-proofing) develops more complex flavors.\\n- **Patience is Key**: Baking sourdough takes practice. Don't be discouraged if your first loaf isn't perfect!\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade sourdough bread!\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Sure!

Prepare the Dough (mixing & bulk fermentation):**\\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and water. Mix until there are no dry bits of flour. It might seem too dry at first, but the flour will absorb the water as it rests.\\n2. Let the mixture rest for 30 minutes. This is called the autolyse.\\n3. After the autolyse, add the ripe sourdough starter and salt. Mix by pinching and folding the dough until the starter and salt are fully incorporated.\\n4. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for about 4-6 hours (depending on the temperature, it should double in size). This is called bulk fermentation.\\n\\n**2. Shape the Dough:**\\n1. After bulk fermentation, turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface.

This example uses a simple sourdough bread recipe.\\n\\n### Equipment\\n- A kitchen scale (recommended)\\n- A digital instant-read thermometer (recommended)\\n- A large mixing bowl\\n- A spatula\\n- A bench scraper (optional, but helpful)\\n- A proofing basket or bowl (banneton)\\n- A Dutch oven or baking stone\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n- **For the levain (starter):**\\n  - 50 grams all-purpose flour\\n  - 50 grams bread flour\\n  - 100 grams water (room temperature)\\n  - 10 grams of active sourdough starter\\n\\n- **For the dough:**\\n  - 450 grams bread flour\\n  - 50 grams whole wheat flour\\n  - 350 grams water (room temperature)\\n  - 10 grams salt\\n  - Levain from above\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n#### Step 1: Prepare the Levain\\n1. The night before you plan to make your sourdough, feed your starter so that it becomes strong and bubbly.\\n2. Add the starter ingredients into a bowl and mix until smooth. Let it sit at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Autolyse\\n1. Mix the bread flour and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Add the water and combine until no dry flour remains. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Mix Dough\\n1. Add the levain and salt to the autolysed dough. Mix by pinching the dough between your fingers until the levain and salt are incorporated.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Bulk Fermentation\\n1. After mixing, let the dough rise at room temperature until it has grown by about 20-30 percent. This will take about 4-6 hours, depending on the room temperature.\\n2. Every 30 minutes during the first 2 hours of bulk fermentation, stretch and fold the dough in the bowl to strengthen it. To stretch and fold, wet your hand, slide it under one side of the dough, and pull it up and over the top of the dough. Rotate the bowl and repeat until you've stretched and folded the dough 4 times.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Pre-shape the Dough\\n1. After bulk fermentation is done, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 2 pieces (for two loaves). Let the pieces rest for 20-30 minutes, covered.\\n\\n#### Step 6: Final Shape\\n1. Shape each piece into a round or oval loaf. Use a bench scraper to create tension on the outer layer of the dough as you shape. \\n\\n#### Step 7: Proof\\n1. Transfer each shaped loaf to a floured proofing basket or bowl, seam side up. Cover and let proof for 1-4 hours at room temperature, or refrigerate and proof overnight.\\n\\n#### Step 8: Preheat the Dutch Oven\\n1. If using a Dutch oven, preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C) the last 30 minutes of proofing.\\n\\n#### Step 9: Score and Bake the Loaf\\n1. When ready to bake, carefully turn one loaf out onto a parchment-lined baking sheet (or onto a pizza peel if using a baking stone). Using a sharp knife or bread lame, score a design on the top of the loaf.\\n2. Carefully transfer the loaf to the preheated Dutch oven (remove the lid first) and cover it; if using a baking stone, place the dough on the stone.\\n3. Bake for 20 minutes with steam (lid on for Dutch oven), then remove the lid and bake for another 25-30 minutes until deep brown.\\n\\n#### Step 10: Cool\\n1. Remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.\\n\\n### Tips\\n- The timing of the recipe can vary. Pay attention to the dough rather than the clock.\\n- If you're new to sourdough baking, consider keeping a log of your process to improve your results over time.\\n- Slice the bread with a serrated knife when completely cooled for the best slices.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade sourdough bread!\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

This starter is fed, left to grow bubbly, and then used to make the bread dough. When baking the dough, the wild yeast will ferment the dough, resulting in the real flavor of sourdough. An ideal starter will also have friendly bacteria that will acidify the dough and enhance its flavor; the bacteria also strengthens gluten, improving the structure of the bread.\\n          \\n                Making a sourdough starter\\n              \\n                     Sourdough starter is made from flour and water, with bits of wild yeast and bacteria from the air or surrounding environment. Starters can be made from all-purpose or whole wheat flour or even from fruits such as grapes or pineapples. A starter can be born from seeds of wild yeast lingering in the air or from unwashed grapes picked from your backyard. It can also be cultivated from a sample of a starter from a neighbor or friend. The whole process takes about two weeks, but once the starter is made, it can be kept indefinitely. Once you've made it, it can be stored in the refrigerator. It should be re-fed about once a week; you can select some to feed and use in a recipe, then leave the rest for yourself. A starter may become an irreplaceable part of your kitchen. It's common for bakers to exchange and use starters from multiple friends and bakers; then each sourdough bread will taste a bit different.\\n                \\n                               Directions\\n                               A new sourdough starter can be made from whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, or rye flour.

Unlike regular bread made with yeast, which relies on added commercial yeast for leavening, sourdough bread is made with a starter, a live culture that is a symbiosis of wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The wild yeast in the starter works a little more slowly than commercial yeast, leading to a slow fermentation. This slow fermentation helps develop an intense flavor. (If you're wondering about the \\\"sour\\\" in sourdough, that comes from the bacteria's production of lactic acid during fermentation.) Sourdough bread also has a crispy crust and chewy, airy interior, often because of the technique employed to make it.\\nSourdough requires a well-fed starter.\\nYou can buy a sourdough starter, or you can make your own. Making your own takes a week or longer to develop a starter that is healthy and lively enough to bake bread (see Making a Sourdough Starter). If you are at home in the kitchen, you also may want to try one of our other delicious bread recipes: White Bread, Whole Wheat Bread, and No-Knead Bread.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Making sourdough bread is a rewarding baking project that does not need store-bought yeast. Here is a beginner's guide to sourdough bread, including instructions for making a starter, as well as helpful tips, troubleshooting advice, and a recipe.\\n\\nSourdough bread depends on wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria in the environment and the flour. Making a starter, which will multiply these wild yeasts and bacteria, is a simple process that only requires regular stirring and feeding, and waiting. Use unbleached all-purpose flour or a combination of whole wheat and all-purpose flour to feed your starter. Fresh flour ensures sufficient food for the yeast, which you will need for a successful loaf of bread otherwise, you may have to wait weeks for a new starter to cultivate enough wild yeast to raise your dough.\\n\\n### Starter\\n\\n* **Wild yeast**: Invisible, wild yeast naturally occurs in the air and in flour. When you combine water and flour and let it sit out, the yeast in both those things starts eating the flour's sugars, and the yeast multiplies.\\n* **Nutrition**: The wild yeast also feeds on sugar in the mixture. As it multiplies, it gives off gases and acids, which create the leavening action (like yeast does) and give sourdough bread its distinct tangy flavor.\\n\\n### Equipment\\n- A large mixing bowl or container to hold your starter and a smaller bowl for mixing the starter.\\n- An airtight container, jar, or crock for storage.\\n- A kitchen scale for measuring. (This is especially useful if you're planning to bake often, so you can replicate successful recipes.)\\n- Plastic wrap or a lid for the container.\\n- A whisk to mix the dough.\\n- A bench scraper for kneading.\\n- A baking stone or covered casserole dish for baking. (A baking sheet works too.)\\n- An instant-read thermometer to check doneness.\\n\\n### Sourdough Starter\\n\\nPlace equal parts of flour and room-temperature water (filtered is fine) in a bowl. Mix and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a towel. Let it sit for 12 to 14 hours in a warm, draft-free area (70 to 75 degrees F). Depending on room conditions, sometimes it will be longer, especially in winter and in the refrigerator). Some bubbles will appear and your starter will have risen. Once this happens, move onto the feeding step.\\n\\nInstead of using a bowl, you can also use the jar in which you plan to store your starter. Just start with less water and flour, so it has room to grow. Do not use a metal bowl.\\n\\nMesh, cheesecloth, or coffee filters (any non-airtight material) can filter air in. A small vent for air to get in and gases to escape helps fermentation move along. Gases in there are ammonia and carbon dioxide. \\n\\n#### Directions\\n\\n1. In the morning, mix 1 tablespoon of your bubbly flour mixture with 1/4 cup of water and a tablespoon of flour that has been unbleached. The container should be at least double the original size of the mixture - it will be easy to see later how much bigger that is. Stir. Cover loosely and place in a warm place, like on top of the fridge.\\n2. The next morning, look (and smell) for bubbles! Now it is time to feed your starter to get it nice and bubbly. Add 1 cup of water and a cup of flour to what is already there (the mixture in step 1) the same way you did before. Stir, cover loosely, and place in a warm place.\\n3. Once a week, feed all of the starter the same way, until you have a cup left.\\n\\nYou don't need to change dishes every time. Just use the same jar or thing you are going to bake with.\\n\\n#### Storage\\nWhen the starter is healthy, you can decide whether to store it in the fridge or leave it out. For more sour bread, leave it out the same way you do in step 1.\\n\\n##### In the refrigerator\\nA few days before you want to bake bread, take it out of the fridge. Now feed it as you did before, and let it sit out overnight. Back in the fridge it goes! You'll want to do this once a week or more to keep the yeast active.\\n\\nRefrigeration helps slow the fermentation and keeps your starter from going bad so quickly. When it is slower, it can make the yeast easier on the flour, even for stronger gluten doughs (like bread). \\n\\nAfter the week has passed, and you're ready to bake, feed it again (see recipe). \\n\\n##### Out of the refrigerator\\nIf you want to leave your starter out of the fridge, you'll need to give it food, space, and air. Give it a cup of flour and a little less than 1 cup of water, and in a room-temperature, large jar where air can circulate\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Sourdough bread is a delicious fermented bread that has a distinct chewy texture and subtle sweetness.

Here are some key points to keep in mind when baking sourdough bread. You can find recipes with specific measurements of ingredients by searching online.\\n                    ^[8]                    ^[9]\\n                \\n                \\n                    Bread baking requires precise measurements.\\n                    To make sourdough bread, it is important to use a kitchen scale to measure the ingredients as weights (in grams) rather than by volume (cups) because weight measurements are more precise. Using grams as a unit of measurement helps guarantee consistent results and is especially important when making sourdough bread, which is a type of lean bread (made without fats, eggs, or dairy products).\\n                \\n                \\n                    Baking bread is a type of science experiment.\\n                    Like all baked goods, bread alters its composition as it is baked, which is why it is important to measure all ingredients correctly and use the right equipment. Here are some tips to keep in mind:         -  Using the right type of flour: Use all-purpose flour or bread flour to get the best results.     -   Weighing ingredients: Using a kitchen scale to weigh food ingredients improves the consistency of the baking result. It is more accurate than measuring them by volume, which may change based on how tightly the ingredients are packed into measuring cups.     -   Kneading dough: Properly kneaded dough has an elastic surface.

Prepare the Sourdough Starter:\\n\\n1. **Feed the Starter**: If you have an existing sourdough starter, feed it 6 to 12 hours before you plan to mix your dough. If you are starting a new one, mix the flour and water in a bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature (70-75\u00b0F/21-24\u00b0C) for 5-7 days, feeding daily with equal parts flour and water. It is ready for the bread dough when bubbles appear, and it doubles in size within 4-6 hours of feeding.\\n\\n#### 2. Mix the Dough:\\n\\n1. **Autolyse**: In a large bowl, mix the 450g bread flour and 350ml water. Stir until there are no dry bits of flour. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.\\n   \\n2. **Add Starter and Salt**: Mix in the 100g of active starter and 10g of salt until fully incorporated. The dough will be sticky.\\n\\n#### 3. Bulk Fermentation:\\n\\n1. **Fermentation**: Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (around 70-75\u00b0F/21-24\u00b0C) for 4-5 hours, or until it has increased in volume and appears slightly domed.\\n\\n2. **Stretch and Fold**: Every 30 minutes during the first 2 hours, wet your hands and reach under one side of the dough, stretch it upward and fold it over onto itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat until you have stretched and folded all sides of the dough. This helps develop gluten strength.\\n\\n#### 4. Pre-shape and Bench Rest:\\n\\n1. **Shape the Dough**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into two equal pieces (if making two loaves). Pre-shape each piece into a round. Cover with a damp cloth for 30 - 60 minutes.\\n   \\n2. **Final Shape**: Shape the dough into tighter rounds or batards based on your preference. Use a bench scraper to aid in creating tension with the dough.\\n\\n#### 5. Cold Proofing:\\n\\n1. **Proof**: Place shaped dough into a proofing basket lined with flour, seam side up. Cover with a damp cloth and put it in the refrigerator overnight for about 12-14 hours.\\n\\n#### 6. Preheat and Prepare to Bake:\\n\\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Place a Dutch oven or baking stone in the oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for at least 30 minutes before baking. \\n\\n#### 7.

Here\u2019s a basic recipe with detailed instructions.\\n\\n### Step 1: Making a Sourdough Starter\\nA sourdough starter is a mixture of flour and water that captures wild yeast and bacteria from the environment.\\n\\n**Ingredients for Starter:**\\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour or whole grain flour\\n- 1/2 cup water (filtered or non-chlorinated)\\n  \\n**Instructions:**\\n1. In a clean glass or plastic container, mix the flour and water together until combined. It should be a thick paste.\\n2. Cover the container loosely with a lid or cloth to allow air in but keep contaminants out.\\n3. Store the container in a warmish place in your kitchen (70\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F is ideal).\\n4. After 24 hours, \\\"feed\\\" the starter by discarding half the mixture and adding 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of water. Stir well.\\n5. Repeat this daily feeding process for about one week. You should see bubbles forming, and the starter should double in size about 4-6 hours after feeding. It will have a pleasant, sour smell when ready.\\n\\n### Step 2: Making Sourdough Bread\\nOnce your starter is active and bubbly, you can make bread.\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n- 100g active sourdough starter (about 1/2 cup)\\n- 375g water (1 1/2 cups) at room temperature\\n- 500g bread flour (4 cups), plus more for dusting\\n- 10g salt (1 3/4 teaspoons)\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n#### 1. Mix\\n1. In a large bowl, mix the starter, water, and 100g of flour until fully combined. Let sit for 30 minutes.\\n2. Add the remaining flour and salt and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\\n\\n#### 2. Autolyse\\n- Let the dough rest for 1 hour. This allows the flour to hydrate.\\n\\n#### 3. Fold\\n1. After the autolyse, stretch and fold the dough in the bowl every 30 minutes for about 2 hours. To stretch and fold, wet your hand to prevent sticking, grab one side of the dough, stretch it upwards, and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat until you've folded all sides.\\n\\n#### 4. Rise\\n- After the folds, let the dough rise undisturbed for 4-6 hours at room temperature, until puffed but not necessarily doubled.\\n\\n#### 5. Pre-shape\\n1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide it into two pieces (for a double recipe).\\n2. Shape each piece into a round ball. Cover with a cloth and let rest for 20-30 minutes.\\n\\n#### 6. Final shape\\n1. Shape each ball into a tighter round or oval loaf by tucking the edges under to create surface tension.\\n2. Place each loaf into a well-floured proofing basket or bowl.\\n\\n#### 7. Proof\\n- Cover the loaves and let sit for 1-2 hours at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight (for a stronger flavor).\\n\\n#### 8. Preheat Oven\\n- About 30 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) with a Dutch oven inside.\\n\\n#### 9. Bake\\n1. Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven. \\n2. Place your loaf on parchment paper and score the top (optional).\\n3. Place the parchment paper with the loaf into the Dutch oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 30 minutes.\\n4.

Stir until there are no dry bits of flour.\\n2. **Cover and Wait**: Cover the container loosely with a lid or cloth; let it sit at room temperature (about 70\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F) away from direct sunlight for 24 hours.\\n3. **Feed the Starter**: After the first day, feed the starter once a day until it becomes bubbly and doubles in size. (You'll do this by discarding half the mixture and adding 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of water each day.)\\n4. **Determine Readiness**: The starter is ready when it doubles in size within 4-6 hours of feeding, has a pleasant sour smell, and bubbles form on the surface.\\n\\n### Step 2: Prepare the Dough\\n1. **Mix**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the starter, water, and 5 cups of flour. Mix until a rough dough forms. It's okay if it's still a bit sticky.\\n2. **Autolyse**: Let the dough rest for 30 minutes. This helps the flour absorb water and gluten to develop.\\n3. **Add Salt**: Add the salt and mix it in by adding a bit more water if necessary to help dissolve it.\\n4. **Knead**: Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\\n\\n### Step 3: Ferment the Dough\\n1. **Bulk Fermentation**: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise at room temperature for 4-8 hours until it has doubled in size.\\n2. **Stretch and Fold**: Every hour during the bulk fermentation, gently stretch and fold the dough in the bowl. This helps develop structure without traditional kneading.\\n3. **Shape**: After the bulk fermentation, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a ball. \\n\\n### Step 4: Second Rise\\n1. **Preshape**: For best results when shaping, let the dough rest uncovered on the work surface for 30 minutes.\\n2. **Final Shape**: After resting, shape the dough into its final shape (round or oval, depending on your proofing basket).\\n3. **Proof**: Place the shaped dough seam-side-up in a floured proofing basket. Cover it and let it proof for 1-3 hours at room temperature, or refrigerate it for 12-24 hours for a slower fermentation.\\n\\n### Step 5: Bake\\n1. **Preheat**: Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). If using a Dutch oven, place it in the oven to heat up.\\n2. **Prepare for Baking**: If proofing in the fridge, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Put parchment paper on a pizza peel or upside-down baking sheet.\\n3. **Score**: Carefully turn the dough onto the parchment paper. Score the top with a sharp knife.\\n4. **Bake**: If using a Dutch oven, carefully remove it from the oven, lift the lid, and slide the parchment paper with the dough inside. Reduce the temperature to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C) and bake with the lid on for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes until brown. For a baking stone or sheet, place it in the oven and steam by placing a metal pan in the bottom of the oven filled with water.\\n5. **Cool**: Once baked, cool the bread completely on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.\\n\\n### Notes\\n- **Hydration**: The higher the hydration (water content), the more open the crumb will be; it's crucial to let the dough rise longer if you want more open holes.\\n- **Experiment**: Play with different flavors, shapes, and add-ins like nuts and dried fruit!\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Set aside a specific time. Start by choosing one or more times in your day to practice. Some people prefer to meditate in the morning, before the day begins, while others prefer to meditate at night, after the day is done. Although some find maintaining a regular schedule to be helpful, it is more important to make the time for meditation than to adhere to a rigid schedule.  2.  Make a commitment. Just as you make a commitment to a regular fitness routine, you also need to make a commitment to a regular meditation routine. It may take some time to form this habit.   3.  Start small. Beginning with just a few minutes of daily meditation is better than doing nothing at all. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually extend the amount of time you spend meditating.  4.  Choose a peaceful environment. Initially, you may want to meditate in a quiet and peaceful environment away from distractions. Once you are comfortable with the practice, you can meditate anywhere.   5.  Don't worry about doing it perfectly. In the beginning, meditation can feel quite unnatural. It's natural for your mind to wander off to other thoughts or experiences when you are trying to meditate. Don't worry about what thoughts cross your mind or about how you feel during meditation. Simply notice what thoughts come to mind and gently return your focus to your breath or setting your intention.\\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                                        Movements and various body positions may provide additional benefits.\\n                                       \\n                                        Tai Chi and yoga are forms of meditation that use movement and body positions in their practice. A series of flowing movements characterize tai chi, while yoga usually consists of some postures, stretches, and positions. Both types of movement meditation are linked to various health benefits, including stress reduction, improved mental health, improved breathing patterns, improved physical fitness and fat burning.\\n                                      \\n                                        Progressive relaxation is another technique used to relieve stress and tension throughout the body by tensing and relaxing specific muscle groups. You will be guided to focus on the different parts of your body one at a time, usually starting at one end (often with the feet) and working your way to the other end (usually the face and head). This technique can be particularly helpful in helping you to recognize the first signs of the physical tension that comes with stress.\\n                                      \\n                                        Here are some helpful meditation techniques to try for added relaxation:\\n                                         -  Meditation. Meditation can produce a state of deep relaxation and a tranquil mind. By focusing your mind, you can reduce the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress.   -  Visualization. Visualization or guided imagery is a technique in which you form mental images of places or situations you find relaxing such as a tropical beach. It usually involves using as many senses as possible, such as smell, sight, sound, and touch, making the experience more vivid. For added benefits, you can listen to recordings of natural sounds or music while you visualize.   -  Focusing on your breathing. Simple breathing exercises may help calm the mind. To try this technique, sit or lie comfortably and close your eyes. Breathe deeply through your nose so that your abdomen, not your chest, expands. Let your abdomen relax, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on your natural breathing, and notice if your mind starts to wander. When you notice that it has, gently redirect your thoughts back to your breath.\\n                                      \\n                                        \\n                                        It may help to learn to meditate with a friend or in a group.

This could be a corner of a room, a garden, or any place where you feel comfortable and relaxed.\\n\\n### 2. Get Comfortable\\n- **Posture**: Sit or lie down in a position that feels comfortable. You can sit cross-legged on a cushion, on a chair with feet flat on the floor, or lie down.\\n- **Body**: Keep your back straight but not stiff. Rest your arms by your sides or on your lap.\\n\\n### 3. Set a Time Limit\\nIf you're a beginner, you might want to start with short sessions, such as 5 or 10 minutes. As you get more used to meditating, you can gradually increase the time.\\n\\n### 4. Choose a Focus Point\\nYou can focus on different things in meditation, including:\\n- **Breath**: Notice the sensation of breath as it goes in and out of your body. You might count each breath in and out.\\n- **Mantra**: Silently repeat a simple word or phrase that has meaning to you.\\n- **Body sensation**: Pay attention to a specific part of your body, noticing how it feels.\\n\\n### 5. Notice When Your Mind Wanders\\nYour attention will inevitably wander away from your focus point. This is completely normal. When you get lost in thought, gently bring your attention back to your focus point without judgment.\\n\\n### 6. Be Kind to Yourself\\nDon't worry about how well you're doing. There is no \\\"right\\\" or \\\"wrong\\\" way to meditate. The important part is that you are making the effort to be present.\\n\\n### 7. Close with Gratitude\\nWhen your meditation session ends, open your eyes slowly. Take a moment to appreciate the time you spent in meditation. Notice how your mind and body feel.\\n\\n### 8. Create a Routine\\nTry to meditate at the same time each day, whether it's in the morning, at lunchtime, or before bed.

Try to be patient, and start with one of these beginner techniques.\\n\\n### Before You Begin\\nChoose a space that is quiet, uncluttered, and ideal for you. A few things to keep in mind when you set your meditation space: - Position your meditation area in a way that feels comfortable and right to you. You may want to face east or north. - Have the tools you need with you when you sit down. You might want a cushion, a chair, or a meditation bench. You might like to burn incense or play soft music. - Make your meditation space represent you. Select pieces that represent your beliefs or aspirations.\\n\\n### Meditation Techniques\\n#### Guided or Visualization Meditation\\nGuided meditation is where you receive mental images and instructions from a guide. Visualization uses mental images of places or things to relax your body and focus your mind. Try this technique: 1.  Sit or lie down comfortably. 2. Close your eyes gently. 3. Take a few deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose and let your belly fill with air. Then breathe out through your mouth. 4. Bring your mind's eye to images or scenes that you find relaxing and calming. For example, a picture of waves crashing on a shore or a grove of trees in sunlight.\\n\\n#### Mantra Meditation \\nMantra meditation is a way of focusing your mind. In this kind of meditation, close your eyes and chant a word or phrase over and over. Mantras are described as virtue-words. They should reflect a quality you want to focus on in your life, such as patience, kindness, or compassion.  Try this technique: 1.  Sit comfortably and close your eyes. 2. Breathe deeply and let the breath out slowly. 3. Pick one word or phrase as your mantra, such as \\\"peace\\\" or \\\"I am calm.\\\" 4. When you're ready, slowly repeat your word or phrase. 5. Don't judge yourself. If you find your mind wanders, return gently to your mantra.\\n\\n#### Walking Meditation \\nWalking meditation is just what it says: You do walking meditation while you walk. This is a good type of meditation for people who get bored or restless while sitting. Walking provides the chance to soothe your body and stimulate your mind with movement. Try this technique in a quiet spot where you won't be interrupted: 1. Let your eyes rest gently on the floor in front of you. 2. Take a moment to notice how your feet and legs feel when you walk. 3. Feel how your body feels with each stretch and movement. Be aware of how your arms, torso, and legs all feel as you walk. 4. Walk slowly and be aware of everything from how the air feels on your skin to the sounds of the floor as you move. For example, feel how your feet connect to the ground with each step.\\n\\n#### Breath Awareness\\nBreath awareness is where you focus on your breathing alone. This technique is often used in mindfulness meditation. It can help you feel calm and grounded and lessen anxiety. It also helps train your mind to focus. Breath awareness is often the first technique offered to students of mindfulness meditation. Once you learn breath awareness, you can use this tool anywhere, at any moment.  Try this technique: 1.  Find a comfortable position (sitting or lying). 2. Bring your attention to how your body breathes. You might want to start by placing one hand on your belly and one on your chest. 3. Feel how your belly moves with the breath. Notice how your body feels inside and out as you breathe: in your thoughts, feelings, and your skin. 4.  If you're not already breathing deeply, let out a long sigh and completely let go of the air. Follow this by breathing in deeply. Then let all the air out again. Repeat this for several minutes until it feels natural.\\n\\n### Tips to Make Meditating Easier\\n-  Avoid distractions. Limit background sounds. Silence calls, texts, and alerts on devices like phones, tablets, and computers. -  Set realistic and positive daily goals. Even 5 minutes of meditation is a win! Longer sessions will come over time. -  Don't judge yourself. If you find your thoughts wandering during meditation, bring your attention back to your breathing. Don't judge yourself for letting this happen.\\n\\n### When to Seek Help\\nAs with any practice, you may find progress slows or even stops at times. Meditation can be difficult or confusing at times. If you have questions, try asking a friend who meditates, speaking to others at your meditation group, or finding a new meditation teacher.\\n                                \\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Meditation is a practice that can take many forms, so the best way to meditate effectively varies from person to person.

You may wish to wear loose, comfortable clothing, sit in a comfortable chair, or sit on a cushion on a mat or carpeted floor. \\n- **Time** - It is helpful to select a specific time each day to meditate. Choose a time you will be free to concentrate without feeling rushed or interrupted. \\n- **Place** - Find a special place that invites you to be still, relax, and enjoy meditation. Choose this place carefully, since too many distractions can make it difficult to concentrate.\\n\\n### The Benefits of Meditation\\nMeditation is an ancient practice with a variety of benefits. It can help you to: \\n- Relax and cope with stress. \\n- Find calmness and peace. \\n- Increase self-awareness and create a feeling of balance. \\n- Feel connected to oneself and/or others. \\n- Promote emotional health by helping to reduce symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and sleep problems.\\n\\n### Prepare for Your First Meditation Session\\nTo prepare for your first meditation session: \\n1. **Gather your supplies**: You may wish to have the following items: -  A comfortable, quiet place. -  A cushion or chair. -  A blanket for warmth and comfort. -  A journal and pen, if you like to write.\\n2. **Plan how long to meditate**: Sessions can be as short as 5 to 10 minutes or more, depending on your needs and experience.\\n3. **Choose a time in your schedule**: It is best to select a time where you can spend time with little or no distractions. Planning a time each day for meditation is a great way to make it a habit.\\n4. **Decide where to meditate**: It is good for beginning meditators to choose a quiet place to meditate. The more often you return to the same spot, the more calm and safe you will feel there.\\n\\n### Things to Think About as You Begin to Meditate\\n\\n- **Have a Focus**: Having a focus can help you keep your attention on your meditation. This focus can be a specific word or phrase (such as \\\"I relax\\\" or \\\"peaceful\\\"), your breath, part of your body, or visualization. It can also be a thought such as \\\"I will not let the little things bother me today.\\\" \\n- **Watch Your Thoughts**: When you notice thoughts drifting into your mind while you meditate, you should understand this is normal. Don't fight the thoughts or feel bad about them. Simply let them come, notice them, and then let them go. Return your focus to help you relax.\\n- **Let Go of Expectations** - You may want a specific outcome from your meditation, such as feeling less stressed or feeling enlightened, but letting go of that expectation may help you achieve that outcome.

{"prompt": "How do I meditate effectively?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Meditation is a skill that can be learned through practice. To meditate effectively, following the steps below may help you to develop an effective meditation practice. However, the best way to know what works is to try different things and follow what feels best.\\n\\n### Preparing for Meditation\\n1. **Choose a quiet space**: Find a location where you won't be interrupted during your meditation, such as a quiet room at home or a peaceful outdoor space.\\n2. **Set a regular time to meditate**: Choose a time each day that fits your schedule and helps you keep your commitment to meditate. Early morning is a good time to meditate because it starts the day on a positive note and is less likely to be interrupted. However, you can meditate any time during the day. \\n3.  **Decide how long to meditate**: If you are a beginner, you might want to start with short periods of time, such as five or ten minutes. You can gradually increase the length of time as you become more comfortable with meditation. You can use a timer so you won't have to think about the time or worry about when to stop.\\n4. **Wear comfortable clothes**: Loose, soft clothing will make it easier for you to relax during meditation. Avoid clothing that might constrict your movement or distract you, such as a necktie or a tight belt.\\n5. **Close your eyes**: If you are comfortable doing so, closing your eyes can help you avoid distractions while you meditate. If you prefer to keep your eyes open, try focusing gently on a spot in front of you on the ground. \\n\\n### Practicing Meditation\\n1. **Get into position**: A comfortable position can help you relax. You may want to sit cross-legged on the floor or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Either position is good. However, if you sit in a chair, you may want to avoid leaning against the back of the chair, which can make it easier for you to relax so much that you fall asleep. After you find a good position, it can help to sit up straight but relaxed, with your back, neck, and head aligned. Your hands can rest open on your knees or in your lap, with palms up or down.  This relaxed and alert position can help you stay focused throughout your meditation. \\n2. **Focus your attention**: Instead of letting your mind wander, noticing all the thoughts that pass through it, you can choose where to focus your attention during meditation. Following your breath can be an easy way to do this. Wherever you begin, gently redirect your attention back to your chosen focus with kindness whenever you notice it drifting away. \\n   - For example, to practice focusing your breath: *Breathe in slowly and deeply. Notice where you feel your breath\u2014perhaps in your nose, chest, or belly. Try to feel your breath without changing how you breathe. As you breathe in and out, notice the rise and fall of your body with each breath. Since your mind may wander away from your breath, you might mentally say the words \\\"in\\\" and \\\"out\\\" to keep your focus on your breath.* \\n3. **Notice your thoughts and feelings**: While focusing your attention during meditation, notice any thoughts, feelings, or sensations that come into your mind. Instead of getting caught up in them, try to imagine them floating into your mind and then slowly floating away, similar to how clouds float in the sky or leaves float by on a stream. \\n\\n### Ending Your Meditation\\n1. **Gently return**: When your meditation period is over, open your eyes if they are closed. Take a moment to notice where you are and what is around you. Gradually return your focus to the present moment.\\n2. **Reflect on your meditation**: After you finish your meditation, it can be helpful to take time to notice how you feel. Compare that feeling to how you felt before you started to meditate. You could even write about your experience in a journal.\\n\\n### Finding Resources for Learning to Meditate\\nThere are many resources available to help you learn to meditate. Examples include:\\n- Books\\n- Smartphone apps\\n- Streaming services\\n- Online videos and websites\\n\\nYou may want to learn from a trained meditation teacher or join a meditation group to help support your practice.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Meditation is a practice that can help you develop a deep sense of peace and calm. It is natural for your mind to wander during meditation, so it is important to gently bring your focus back whenever you notice your thoughts drifting.

Find a Quiet Space\\nChoose a quiet, comfortable place where you won't be disturbed. This could be a corner of your room, a garden, or any place that feels peaceful to you.\\n\\n### 2.

Set a Time Limit\\nIf you're just starting out, it can be helpful to choose a short time limit, such as 5 or 10 minutes. As you become more comfortable with meditation, you may want to meditate for longer periods.\\n\\n### 4. Focus on Your Breath\\nClose your eyes softly and bring your attention to your breathing. Notice the sensation of air entering your nostrils, filling your lungs, and leaving your body. You might count your breaths (inhale = 1, exhale = 2, etc.) to help maintain your focus. \\n\\n### 5. Notice Your Thoughts\\nAs you meditate, thoughts will come into your mind. This is completely normal. Instead of trying to suppress those thoughts, notice when they occur and gently redirect your focus back to your breath or mantra.\\n\\n### 6. Use a Mantra (Optional)\\nYou can choose to repeat a word, phrase, or sound (mantra) to focus your mind. Some people use traditional mantras such as \\\"Om\\\" or \\\"Peace.\\\" \\n\\n### 7. End Your Session\\nWhen your meditation time is up, open your eyes slowly. Take a moment to notice your surroundings before standing up. Check in with your body and feelings, and see if you can carry a sense of calm into the rest of your day.\\n\\n### 8. Be Kind to Yourself\\nDon't judge yourself or your meditation session. Every time you meditate, it\u2019s a little different. It's okay if your mind wanders; just return your focus to your breath or your chosen focal point.\\n\\n### 9. Practice Regularly\\nTry to meditate at the same time each day, to develop it into a habit. Whether in the morning to start your day calmly, in the middle of the day to center yourself, or at night to wind down before sleep, regular practice enhances the benefits of meditation.\\n\\n### Additional Tips:\\n- **Try Guided Meditations:** If you find it hard to meditate on your own, consider using apps or websites that offer guided meditations.\\n- **Experiment with Different Types:** There are many forms of meditation, such as mindfulness, loving-kindness, body scan, and transcendental meditation. Try a few to see what resonates with you.\\n- **Join a Group:** Meditating with others can provide support and motivation.

For a beginner, the following steps can help cultivate a strong meditation practice.\\n\\n### 1. Find a quiet space\\nSelect a peaceful spot where you won\u2019t be disturbed. A calm environment will make it easier to focus. Don\u2019t make this too complicated. A corner of your living room will work just fine. Over time, your body will associate meditation with this spot.\\n\\n### 2. Set a time limit\\nFor your first few sessions, meditate for 5 to 10 minutes. As you get used to the practice, you can increase the time. Use a timer or the timer function on your phone so you aren\u2019t tempted to check the time. Choose a pleasant chime to signal that your session is over.\\n\\n### 3. Assume a comfortable position\\nYou can sit on the floor, in a chair, or lie down. Keep your back straight, yet relaxed. Closing your eyes may lessen distractions, but it\u2019s also fine to keep your eyes open and gaze downward. Hands can rest in your lap, at your sides, or on your knees. Do whatever feels best for you.\\n\\n### 4. Breathe\\nTake a few deep breaths. If it feels good, you might want to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. With each inhale, feel your body energized. With each exhale, release any tension. Then let your breath become natural. Notice the sensations of your breath.\\n\\n### 5. Focus your attention \\nConsider using one of the following methods to direct your attention:  \\n- **Breath**. Focus your attention on your breathing. Notice how your body feels with each inhale and exhale. If your breath feels shallow or rushed, don\u2019t judge it: simply notice. Watch your stomach or chest rise with each breath.  \\n- **Mantra**. Choose a word, phrase, or sound that you repeat. Some examples are \u201cI Am\u201d or \u201cOhm.\u201d  \\n- **Visualization**. Picture a calm scene, such as a quiet beach or meadow. As you focus on the details here\u2014the colors, sounds, even scents\u2014allow this image to fill your mind.\\n\\n### 6. Ease back when distractions occur\\nYour mind will inevitably drift to thoughts, feelings, sounds, or other distractions. When you notice this, gently but firmly bring your attention back to the object of your focus (your breath, mantra, etc.).\\n\\n### 7. End your session\\nWhen your time is up, open your eyes (if closed) and notice how you feel. You may want to take a moment before getting up to appreciate this feeling. You may choose to keep a journal to track your experiences.\\n\\n### 8. Practice regularly\\nMeditation is a skill that takes practice. Try to meditate daily. As you establish a routine, you may find it easier to begin your sessions. Weekdays often work best for people trying to create habits.\\n\\n### Considerations\\n- **Guided meditations** can help you learn meditation techniques.

Your plans will need to accommodate stops to eat, stretch your legs, and see interesting attractions. If you're on a long road trip, you might want to add rest stops so you can nap or switch drivers.

Look for nearby restaurants, attractions, and lodging before you head out.\\n\\n                                3. Budget your trip.\\n                                   Estimate the total cost of your trip (e.g., food, attractions) to help you stick to a budget. Take into consideration how many miles you'll be driving and make a rough estimate of gas costs based on your vehicle's miles per gallon. You also may want to set aside a small amount as a contingency fund for unexpected expenses that come up along the way. \\n\\n                                4. Share the drive time.\\n                                   Plan to share the driving with others who are going with you. Taking turns will reduce fatigue and the boredom of constant driving. If you can, try to have someone besides the driver share your vehicle's front seat. Having a passenger beside you will help keep you alert.\\n\\n                                5. Get your vehicle ready.\\n                                   Prepare your vehicle for the trip by having it checked by a mechanic. The mechanic should inspect the tires (including the spare), brakes, battery, lights, fluid levels, and air filter. Depending on when your vehicle's last maintenance was, you may want to do the following:        - Have the oil changed.     - Check the brakes.      - Check for worn tires that should be replaced and check that new tires are properly balanced and aligned.     - Clean the battery terminals.     - (For trips in hot weather) make sure the coolant is filled to the proper level. Take note of the vehicle's temperature gauge during the trip.     - (For winter trips) check the antifreeze. If you're an experienced do-it-yourselfer, check for and replace worn belts and hoses.     - Make sure the heater and windshield wipers work.     - Make sure the air filter is clean. An air filter that's clogged can reduce fuel economy.    \\n\\n                                6. Find the best price for hotels.\\n                                   Find places to stay that fit your budget and are conveniently located. Search travel websites or hotel booking apps for the best deals. Consider other options such as motels, campgrounds, or traveling with friends or family and staying with them. \\n\\n                                7. Plan for emergencies.\\n                                   Take a few reasonable steps to prepare for emergencies. Plan for possibilities such as bad weather, and always have a backup route. Take needed tools. Be ready for the worst\u2014keep jumper cables, a flashlight and extra batteries, and a first-aid kit in your vehicle. Also pack a small amount of food and water, blankets, and some extra clothes such as a raincoat. It's a good idea to keep your phone charged and to have an extra mobile battery charger on hand in case you need it. \\n\\n                                8. Make a physical map backup. \\n                                   Whether you're using a digital map or a paper map, having a backup can help avoid surprises. If you're using a digital map, be sure to take a paper map as a backup. If you're planning to travel through remote areas, know ahead of time how you'll connect to the internet to access a digital map.\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

To prepare, you can make a good impression by making sure that you are: \\n* aware of the basics of job interviewing and \\n* able to answer questions that employers regularly ask during job interviews. \\nYou can also reduce your anxiety about a job interview by knowing that you have done everything possible to present your qualifications in a positive way. \\n\\nThis information is for anyone who is planning to go on a job interview.

For example, you usually have a lot of control over what you talk about in other interviews. However, in a job interview, the interviewer controls the conversation. \\n\\nBe aware of what employers are looking for. You can expect potential employers to look for two things in you: \\n* You need to have the skills and experience necessary to do the job. \\n* You need to fit in with the company's culture. \\n\\nTo meet these expectations, show that you: \\n* Have done enough research about the position and employer to ask and answer questions from a knowledgeable point of view \\n* Know your strengths and how to market them to an employer \\n* Are flexible and organized in your approach to the interview \\n\\nSee the [National Association of Colleges and Employers' (NACE) Job Search Guide](https://www.naceweb.org) for more information about what employers are looking for. \\n\\n### Structure your answers to common interview questions\\nTo prepare for common questions and be ready to direct the conversation, use the STAR interview response technique. Describe specific examples of situations you have been in, the tasks you had to complete, the actions you took, and the results of your actions. For example: \\n* Situation: Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you had to tackle. Be specific about when and where this took place. \\n* Task: Describe what your responsibility was in that situation. \\n* Action: Explain what steps you took to address it. \\n* Result: Share what happened as a result of your actions. What did you accomplish? What did you learn? \\n\\nWhen answering behavioral and situational interview questions (questions that begin with \\\"Tell me about a time when\\\" or \\\"What would you do if?\\\"), follow the tips below: \\n* Use the STAR response technique. \\n* Be concise and stay on topic. \\n* Answer clearly with lots of examples. \\n* Watch the interviewer's body language to make sure you are not showing too little interest or talking too much. \\n\\n## Practice common interview questions\\nEmployers ask many different kinds of interview questions. Think about your answers to these questions and practice saying them aloud. \\n\\n### Be prepared for these kinds of interview questions. \\n* **General questions** Do you work well with other people? What are three things you can bring to this organization? Tell me about yourself. Why are you interested in this position? Why do you want to work for this organization? \\n* **Behavioral questions** Have you ever worked on a project in a team? What role did you play? What was the outcome? Have you ever worked with someone who was difficult to get along with? How did you handle it? \\n* **Situational questions** What would you do if you made a mistake in a report? What would you do if a team member was not carrying his or her weight? How would you handle a difference of opinion with your boss? \\n* **Technical questions** What does ____ mean? (specific to the industry and job). Why would you use HTML? \\n* **Trick questions** If you could be any animal, what would you be? How many children are born each day? \\n\\nTry to think of a few questions to ask the interviewer. Common questions to ask include: \\n* What do you expect a person to accomplish in the first six months on the job? \\n* What are the biggest challenges I would face in this position? \\n* Where does this position fit in within the organization? \\n* How will I be trained? \\n* Can you give me an example of a typical day? \\n* What do you like best about working here? \\n* What do you expect me to accomplish in this role? \\n* What are the next steps in your process? \\n\\n## Give your interview an edge\\nYou can make a great impression in your interview by demonstrating that you care about this opportunity.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"To prepare for a job interview, you should research the company and the role, practice common interview questions, dress appropriately, and prepare questions to ask the interviewer.

Each step involves several tasks. Here's an overview of how to start a podcast: 1. **Plan your podcast**: * Choose a name, define the topic, and create a description. * Create podcast art based on the design guidelines and specifications for artwork that displays in all podcast directories. * Write and rehearse an introduction that captures the essence of your podcast. * Create a short trailer that includes the introduction and an excerpt or example of an episode. * Choose a podcast release schedule, and create a list of episode ideas. 2. **Record your podcast**: * Choose a method for recording. * Choose audio recording and editing equipment and software: \\t- Microphone: USB or XLR. \\t- Headphones. \\t- Mixer (optional). \\t- Recording software for audio. \\t- Services for remote interviews. * Record your podcast episodes. 3. **Produce your podcast**: * Edit your episodes. * Choose and download audio for music and effects. * Save and upload your files. * Choose and register with a podcast hosting service. * Publish your podcast episodes.\\n                    \\n      \\n\\n\\n                    Plan your podcast\\n                \\n\\n    Follow these four steps for your podcast plan:\\n    \\n    \\n    1. **Choose a name, define the topic, create a description**: \\n         * Choose a name: Each podcast should have its own name. Your podcast name is what people see when they search for podcasts. Your podcast can be a part of a podcast series that has its own name also.    For example, if your podcast has the name \\\"Mindful Eating\\\" it could be part of a series called \\\"Kitchen Fables.\\\"      Here are rules about podcast names:     - You can change the name after you create your podcast, but it may need to be changed in many places such as in podcast directories and on your social media.    - When you select a name, search for similar podcast names in the Apple Podcasts Directory, Spotify, Goodpods, or other podcast directories. If you find many similar podcast names, you will probably want to choose a different name. Similar names may draw listeners away from your podcast.       * Define the topic: Each podcast episode should relate to the podcast topic or theme. Always stay on topic with each episode!   Use simple language when you write about your podcast. Your description is what people see when they search for new podcasts in directories, such as Spotify and Google Podcasts.    For example, if your podcast is about healthy eating but most of your episodes are about junk food, your episodes might confuse or disappoint listeners. This is especially true if you target your podcast to a specific audience, such as teenagers or families. If you plan to talk about a wide range of topics, you can one of a few things:    - Keep your podcast description vague that allows for all types of topics.    - Make sure your name or description tells listeners that you will talk about a wide range of topics, such as a talk show.       * Create a description: A short and simple description of each episode gives potential listeners more information about your podcast. This may help get more people to listen!  The description is a few short sentences about yourself and why you are the best person to host a podcast about the topic.  A well-written and detailed episode description gives potential listeners more information about your podcast. This may help get more people to listen! \\n          \\n    \\n    2. **Create podcast art**: \\n         Podcast art is the image for your podcast. It's the first thing a potential listener sees when they find your podcast in a directory, such as Spotify or Google Podcasts.     Podcast art should follow these guidelines:    - Dimensions: Ideal podcast art dimensions are 3000 x 3000 pixels for square art for each episode. - Quality: Use JPEG or PNG file types. Files need to be RGB color. - File size: File size should be 500 KB or smaller.    Note: Creating the image at a larger file size then reducing the image size is helpful because when you reduce an image, the quality of the image often improves.     Ensure your podcast art does not include artwork that you do not have permission to use. You can use royalty-free images or find a graphic designer to create your artwork. \\n         \\n    \\n    3. **Write and rehearse an introduction**: \\n         A good introduction can get your audience interested in your content. Practice and rehearse reading or saying your introduction so it sounds relaxed and natural. Your introduction should include these elements:     * 3 to 5 tags or keywords about your podcast.     * The title of your podcast.     * Early teasers: General and simple explanation of what your podcast is about.     * 1-good reason for listeners to keep listening.    * Your name.\\n         \\n    \\n    4. **Create a short\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a podcast involves several steps.

Then think of whether you need to buy or borrow anything else or ask someone with tech knowledge to help you.     *   **Get Sound**     *   **Edit and enhance**     *   **Choose a host platform.** The host is the service that stores episodes of your podcast on its servers for users to download and listen. It may also automatically send new episodes to where users find podcasts online, such as Apple Podcasts. Some ecosystems or platforms, including Buzzsprout, Libsyn, Podbean, and Weebly, help podcasters find transferring episodes while others on the market help find advertising sponsors.    *   **Now it's almost time to launch!**     *   **Make a trailer.**  A trailer is like an advertisement to get people interested in your podcast and encourage them to listen to your first episode as soon as it is available.\\n          Throughout this process, continue to consider the reasons you decided to create a podcast. These motivations will help guide you toward creating a podcast that reflects your interests and values and works for your time and resources.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a podcast involves several key steps, from planning your content to publishing your first episode.

If you've never made a podcast before, there are various things you'll want to consider while developing your show's concept, design, and marketing strategy. This guide reviews the necessary steps for starting a new podcast and links to other resources that explain certain topics in more detail. It can help you decide whether podcasting is a good fit for you.    ### Find your podcasting topic     The first step to starting a successful podcast is choosing a subject for your show. Think about these questions:       -  Who is my intended audience?    -  What is my podcast about?    -  What is new and different about my podcast?    -  What form will my show take?    -  How long will my show be?    -  How many episodes will I make?    -  Am I committed to keeping the podcast going for a while?     -  Will I have guests, or will it just be me?    -  What is my podcast's tone?    -  What makes me an expert on this subject?    -  What is my podcast's title?       The title of your podcast and its description in the podcast directories are key for appealing to potential listeners.   Include the main keywords your audience will search for to find your type of podcast. Keep the title short, catchy, and few words if possible.   Your podcast might reach a larger audience if you consider linking it to things are timely like events or trends in pop culture, as long as it fits within your show's format. Doing this from the start can help your podcast become popular and grow your audience.   Also think about naming no more than 10 potential episodes. You can develop or change your podcast concept as you go, but coming up with some episode ideas early on may help clarify what your show will sound like.    ### Plan your podcast's branding     Branding is how you show your audience who you are, what you're about, and why they should listen to you instead of anyone else. Building a brand helps you create an identity. Think about:        -  Your logo: Your logo might be a photograph, an illustration, or just something with letters.  Choose a design that reflects your podcast.    -  Cover art: A photo or image that listeners will see when they search for your show. Make sure the cover art stands out.

Here are some tips to help you get started:\\n\\n### Choose a Location\\n- **Sunlight**: Most vegetables need full sun, so pick a spot that gets at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.\\n- **Accessibility**: Make sure the garden is easily accessible for watering, weeding, and harvesting.\\n- **Water supply**: A nearby water source will make it easier to keep your garden well-watered.\\n\\n### Decide What to Grow\\n- **Choose the right vegetables**: Consider your climate, the season, and how much sun the area gets. Some vegetables grow better in certain climates and times of year than others.\\n- **Plan the layout**: Determine the size of your garden and how much space each vegetable needs. Consider companion planting, where certain plants can benefit each other when grown nearby.\\n\\n### Prepare the Soil\\n- **Clear the area**: Remove any grass, weeds, or debris from the plot.\\n- **Till the soil**: Loosen the soil with a shovel or garden fork to a depth of at least 12 inches. This allows roots to grow deeper and improves drainage.\\n- **Add nutrients**: Mix in organic matter, like compost or well-rotted manure, to improve soil quality and provide nutrients.\\n\\n### Plant Your Seeds or Seedlings\\n- **Follow depth instructions**: Some seeds need to be planted deep in the soil while others should be planted just under the surface. Read the seed packet for instructions.\\n- **Water gently**: After planting, water the area gently to avoid washing away the seeds.\\n\\n### Care for Your Plants\\n- **Water regularly**: Vegetables usually need about 1 inch of water each week, either from rainfall or irrigation. Try to water in the morning to prevent disease.\\n- **Weed often**: Weeds compete with your vegetables for nutrients, water, and sunlight. Pull weeds by hand or use a hoe to keep them under control.\\n- **Watch for pests and diseases**: Check your plants regularly for signs of trouble. If you spot any problems, act quickly to manage them.\\n\\n### Harvest Your Vegetables\\n- **Pick vegetables regularly**: Many vegetables will keep growing if you frequently harvest them, especially beans, zucchini, and tomatoes.\\n- **Enjoy!**: Fresh vegetables from your garden can be enjoyed all summer long.\\n\\n### Additional Tips\\n- Consider starting with a few pots of vegetables if you're new to gardening.\\n- Join a local gardening club or find online gardening communities for more tips and advice.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a vegetable garden can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience! Here are some key steps and tips to help you get started on your vegetable gardening journey.\\n\\n### 1. **Choose a Location**\\n   - **Sunlight**: Most vegetables need at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Observe your yard or garden space for sun patterns.\\n   - **Accessibility**: Choose a spot close to a water source and your kitchen for convenience.\\n   - **Protection**: Avoid areas where harmful pests or diseases have affected plants in the past. \\n\\n### 2. **Decide What to Grow**\\n   - Start with a few easy crops and gradually add different vegetables as you learn more.\\n   - Consider your family's preferences, as well as your climate and the length of your growing season.\\n   - Make selections based on your gardening zone. Use a gardening zone map (USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map) to inform your choices.\\n\\n### 3. **Select a Garden Format**\\n   - **In-Ground**: A traditional garden plot tilled into the ground.\\n   - **Raised Beds**: A gardening style in soil that is built higher than the ground similar to a box, without a bottom.\\n   - **Containers**: Any container that holds soil and has holes for drainage.\\n   - **Vertical**: A gardening style that grows plants upward using trellises, which are tall frames.\\n\\n### 4. **Prep the Soil**\\n   - Clear the area of sod and weeds. \\n   - Loosen the soil with a shovel or garden fork to a depth of about 12 to 18 inches. \\n   - Improve your soil by mixing in several inches of organic matter, such as compost, well-rotted manure, or soil mix. \\n\\n### 5. **Plant the Seeds or Start the Plants**\\n   - Check the seed packet or plant tag for details on planting depth and spacing. \\n   - Consider starting seeds in small containers indoors to get a jump on the season. \\n   - For best results, follow the recommended times for planting dates, spacing, and depths.\\n\\n### 6. **Watering Your Plants**\\n   - Water new plants gently but thoroughly to avoid washing seeds away.\\n   - Make sure your garden gets about an inch of rain or watering each week.\\n   - Avoid getting water on leaves and instead water at the root level. Wet leaves can encourage diseases.\\n\\n### 7. **Maintain Your Garden**\\n   - **Mulch**: Spread 2 to 4 inches of mulch around the plants to help retain moisture and deter weeds as the plants grow.\\n   - **Weed**: Check for weeds regularly and remove them by hand or with a hoe.\\n   - **Fertilizer**: Side-dress plants with compost, mulch, or slow-release fertilizer during the growing season as necessary. \\n\\n### 8. **Pest Control**\\n   - Inspect your plants regularly for signs of insects or disease.\\n   - Attract helpful insects by planting flowers nearby. \\n   - Use pesticides only as a last resort, when pests threaten your crop and you can't control them by hand-picking, insect traps, or washing with soap and water.\\n\\n### 9. **Harvest**\\n   - Harvest vegetables regularly to encourage continued production.\\n   - Choose the right time to harvest. Vegetables are tastiest when harvested at their peak ripeness. \\n\\n### 10. **Clean Up**\\n   - At the end of the growing season, remove all plants, weeds, and debris from your garden area. \\n   - If any plants had diseases, remove them instead of composting. \\n   - Add compost or other organic materials to replenish your soil for the next growing season.\\n\\n### Additional Tips\\n- Keep a garden journal to record what works and what doesn\u2019t in your garden.\\n- Consider joining a local gardening club for tips specific to your area.\\n- Take the time to enjoy the process; caring for plants is a form of relaxation for many.\\n\\nHappy gardening!

Choose a Location\\n- **Sunlight**: Most vegetables need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.\\n- **Accessibility**: Ensure easy access for watering, weeding, and harvesting.\\n- **Water Source**: Proximity to a water source will make it easier to keep your garden hydrated.\\n\\n### 2. Plan Your Garden\\n- **Size**: Consider starting small (about 10-15 square feet) until you learn how much you will use.\\n- **Layout**: Decide whether to have rows, raised beds, or containers. Rows are easy to weed and water. Raised beds can be easier to reach and may need fewer weeds.\\n- **Vegetable Selection**: Choose vegetables that you like to eat and are suited to your climate and soil. Beginners may want to start with easy-to-grow vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and salad greens.\\n\\n### 3. Prepare the Soil\\n- **Soil test**: It's a good idea to test your soil to determine its pH and nutrient levels. You can send a sample to a local cooperative extension service or use a home testing kit.\\n- **Improve the soil**: Most vegetables prefer loamy, well-drained soil that's rich in organic matter. You can improve your soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure.\\n- **Weed**: Remove all weed and grass from the area. You might want to use cardboard or mulch to suppress weeds.\\n\\n### 4. Plant Your Seeds or Seedlings\\n- **Seeds vs. Seedlings**: Some plants grow better when started from seeds, while others do better when nursery-grown seedlings are transplanted to the garden.\\n- **Follow Instructions**: Every type of seed comes with specific planting guides. (If in doubt, follow the instructions or ask a gardening expert.)\\n- **Water Gently**: Water seeds gently after planting so you don\u2019t wash them away.\\n\\n### 5. Maintain Your Garden\\n- **Watering**: Keep your garden watered. Vegetables typically need 1 inch of water per week. If that doesn't come from rainfall, you will need to water (usually more often in containers).\\n- **Mulching**: Add mulch around your plants to help keep the soil moist and prevent weeds.\\n- **Weeding**: Remove weeds regularly, especially when they're small.\\n- **Fertilizing**: Depending on your soil, you may need to add compost or fertilizer during the growing season.\\n- **Pest Control**: Watch for garden pests and remove them by hand or with insecticidal soap.\\n\\n### 6. Harvest\\n- **Timing**: Most vegetables are best when they're young and tender. The more often you harvest your vegetables, the more they will produce.\\n\\n\\n### General Tips\\n- **Keep a Garden Journal**: To help plan the next year's garden, keep a record of what you planted, where you planted it, and other observations.\\n- **Don\u2019t Give Up**: New gardeners sometimes see gardening failures. Learning from your mistakes will increase your chance of success next time.\\n\\n\\n### Resources\\nIf you're new to gardening, ask neighbors or friends who garden for tips, and consult your local garden supply center about which crops grow best in your area.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a vegetable garden can be a rewarding experience!

Here are the steps and some tips to help you get started:\\n\\n### Planning Your Garden\\n1. **Decide What to Grow**: Choose vegetables that you and your family like to eat. Beginners might choose easy vegetables, such as lettuce, carrots, radishes, tomatoes, or peppers.\\n  \\n2. **Find a Location**: Look for a spot with plenty of sun (at least 6 to 8 hours each day). Ensure the area is near a water source and has good drainage.\\n\\n3. **Consider Your Space**: You can garden in a variety of spaces\u2014traditional plots, raised beds, containers, or vertical gardens if space is limited.\\n\\n### Preparing the Site\\n4. **Test the Soil**: Use a soil testing kit to see if your soil has the right pH and nutrients for growing vegetables. You can pick one up at a garden center, and your local extension service can analyze it for you.\\n\\n5. **Choose the Right Soil**: Well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter is ideal for growing vegetables. If planting in heavy clay or sandy soil, improve it by adding compost or well-rotted manure.\\n\\n### Planting the Garden\\n6. **Decide Between Seeds or Transplants**: Seeds are often less expensive, but some vegetables (like tomatoes and peppers) are easier to start indoors from transplants. For beginners, buying transplants may help them feel more successful.\\n\\n7. **Check the Best Planting Times**: Find planting dates and information about how deep to plant seeds and transplants on the seed packet or plant label, or check with your local extension service for recommendations.\\n\\n8. **Plan Your Rows**: When planting seeds directly into the garden, draw a diagram to plan how far apart rows of vegetables should be. Rows should be only as long as you can easily reach from one side to another (about 3 feet) so you don\u2019t have to step in the soil, which can make it compact. Rows should be 18 to 36 inches apart.\\n\\n### Caring for Your Garden\\n9. **Water Regularly**: Watering is very important during dry weather, especially for young vegetables. Check your garden daily. If the soil feels dry an inch below the surface, it\u2019s time to water. Water deeply to encourage the roots to go deep into the soil.\\n\\n10. **Mulch After Planting**: A layer of mulch can help keep weeds down, prevent soil from drying out, and keep vegetables clean. Try using straw, shredded leaves, or grass clippings.\\n\\n11. **Keep an Eye on Weeds**: Pull any weeds that pop up. Don\u2019t let them get a chance to steal nutrients from your vegetables.\\n\\n12. **Watch for Pests**: Check your plants regularly for insects or damage. A strong jet of water often removes pests. You can also pick them off by hand. Spraying infected plants with a solution of 1 tablespoon of liquid soap mixed with 1 quart of water may help. Test this on a small part of the plant first to make sure it does not harm the plant. You can also ask at a garden center for other solutions.\\n\\n### Enjoying Your Harvest\\n13. **Eat Fresh!**: You can pick some vegetables as soon as they start to ripen. Others, like tomatoes and peppers, taste better if you wait a few days. Harvesting regularly helps keep plants producing throughout the season.\\n\\n### Tips\\n- Start small. It's better to have a small, well-tended garden than a large one that becomes a chore.\\n- Keep a garden journal to track what you planted when, what worked, and what didn't for next year's planning.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}
{"prompt": "How do I start a vegetable garden Can you explain?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a vegetable garden is a rewarding and enjoyable experience. Below are some basic steps to help you start your vegetable garden. \\n\\n### 1. Choose a Location\\nPick a spot in your yard that gets **6-8 hours of sunlight per day** and has easy access to water. The area should have **good drainage**, as standing water can damage or kill plants. Make sure to choose a level spot, as sloped gardens are prone to erosion.\\n\\n### 2. Plan Your Garden\\nMake a list of vegetables that you and your family like to eat. For a first-time garden, start easy. Include **vegetables** that will be eaten fresh, such as tomatoes, peppers, and carrots.  You might also want to have **herbs** like basil or parsley.\\n\\n### 3. Prepare the Soil\\nMost vegetables grow best in **loose, well-drained soil** that is rich in organic matter. Here\u2019s how to improve your soil:\\n- **Test your soil**: Find out the soil pH (acid/alkaline level) and nutrient needs. Check with your local county extension office for testing kits and recommendations.\\n- **Add organic matter**: Add one or more inches of organic matter (like compost) and mix it into the top inches of soil.\\n- **Rake the area level**: Use a rake to break up any large clumps of dirt and remove rocks from the soil.\\n\\n### 4. Separate the Garden Into Rows or Beds\\nAn easy way to plant the seeds is to separate the garden into **rows or square foot styles**. For rows, you can use the following guidelines:\\n- Plan to make rows **3 feet wide**, leaving pathways of 1 to 2 feet in between. Put shorter vegetables, such as radishes and greens, at the beginning of the row and taller vegetables in the back. This way, all vegetables get enough sunlight. \\n- Rows should run north and south. This ensures that vegetables get sunlight all day. \\n\\nIf using a square-foot or raised bed arrangement, see this resource on  **Square Foot Gardening** (link) or this resource on how to create a  **Raised Bed Garden** (link). \\n\\n### 5. Growing Seeds Indoors\\nSeeds will germinate best in a warm location. If you do not have such a spot, use a flat heating mat to keep the soil warm. Here are a few tips for growing seeds indoors:\\n- Use a seed starting tray or a pot with drainage holes. \\n- Fill the tray or pot with seed starting soil, a light, fluffy mixture that helps seeds sprout.\\n- Water the soil before planting so that it is evenly moist.\\n- Plant the seeds as deep as the package tells you. Each kind of seed has a different depth. \\n- Mark the spot with the name and date planted. If the seeds have not come up in the time told on the package, get new seeds.\\n\\n### 6. Transplant Seedlings\\nKnow when to start seedlings indoors, depending on the type of position and climate and then plant seedlings outdoors when it is time. Guidelines include:\\n- Check your growing zone's hardiness zone on the USDA map site at https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov.\\n- Find out your area's **last frost date**. The hardiness zone or last frost date helps tells what plants will be treated as a perennial or annual. This means whether it will live more than a year or not.\\n- Check the seed packet for guidance on when seedings should be transplanted outdoors. **Calculate backwards** from your area\u2019s last frost date to know when to start seeds indoors. \\n\\n### 7. Plant Vegetable Seeds or Transplants\\nYou can either plant seeds directly into your garden or transplant seedlings you have grown indoors.\\n- **Planting seeds** directly into your garden: Check the seed package for planting depth and how far apart to plant seeds in a row. After planting the seeds, water the area gently to avoid washing away the seeds. \\n- **Planting transplants** into your garden: Check the seedlings for color and overall health. Dig holes that are the same depth as the seedling's pot and twice as wide. Spacing will depend on the type of plant. Read the seedling pot's tags or check with a local gardening expert if you are unsure. \\n\\n### 8. Water Care\\nCheck the moisture of your dirt with your finger, a pencil, or a soil moisture meter.\\n- Give your dirt a good soaking a few times a week instead of sprinkling plants each day. Deep watering encourages the plants roots grow down. \\n- Water in the morning, if possible. Using drip irrigation or soaker hoses will lessen disease.\\n\\n### 9. Maintain the Garden\\nTo keep the garden neat:\\n- Put mulch like grass clippings or wood chips between plants to block weeds and keep moisture in the soil.\\n- Use\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a vegetable garden is a rewarding and practical endeavor.

Here is a simple step-by-step guide to help you start your own vegetable garden: 1. **Decide what to plant**:  Determine what vegetables you want to grow based on your dietary needs, cooking preferences, and the climate and season (see: Choosing Vegetables). 2. **Choose a suitable site**:  Look for a site that meets the requirements of a garden and where you can grow vegetables easily (see: A Good Home for your Garden). 3. **Create your garden**:  Prepare your garden with the following three steps:    - **Test your soil**: Check your soil for pH and nutrient levels. See the section on Soil Test for assistance.    - **Add nutrients**: Get your soil ready to grow plants by adding organic matter. See the section on Compost for suggestions.     - **Prepare the garden beds**: Shape your soil and prepare your garden beds. See the section on Garden Beds for options.   __Optional:__ If you think there might be harmful pests or chemicals in the soil, you can also plant in pots or raised beds.   4. **Plant your garden**:  Choose the planting method that works best for each vegetable you selected (see: Methods of Planting Seeds). 5. **Take care of your garden**:  Once plants are growing, they need care  (see: Caring for Plants). 6. **Harvest your crop**:  Enjoy the harvest (see: Following the Harvest).   If you are not sure how to do something, see the section in this guide that meets your need.   Additional information tailored to your area is available from the Home and Garden Information Center, your local Cooperative Extension service, or the Master Gardeners in your area.   Return to the top of the page.                A Good Home for your Garden                Vegetable gardens can be laid out in several ways and sized to fit the gardener. Consider how much time and energy you will devote to watering, weeding, and harvesting your crop.     - __Full sun__: Selected garden spots should have full sun, receiving 6 or more hours of sunlight each day. Most vegetables need full sun to grow and product quality vegetables. Choose sunny spots that don't get shaded by buildings or fences. Check to see if trees, such as flowering trees, will lose their leaves or drop their seeds on your garden. Some trees, such as black walnut, squeeze nutrients out of the soil that hurt vegetable plants. If your space is shady, consult a garden center or your local Cooperative extension office for vegetable recommendations.      - __Near the house__: Vegetable gardens need regular care, especially watering. Place your garden close to a water source and where it can be seen often, such as by the back door. To be safe, keep tools close at hand, locked in a shed or garage if there is children playing in the area.     - __Good air flow__: If possible, garden beds should not be too porous or in piles.

For more help finding a suitable garden space, see the section on involving children with gardening (Improving the Lawns Around Your Garden).   Return to the top of the page.                Methods of Planting Seeds                Select the best planting method for each vegetable you are growing. Follow the planting instructions on seed package labels. Most vegetable seeds can be sown, or planted, in the soil while the plant is sprouting. Place seeds in the soil about the depth listed on the package label. See the following options:     - __Seed potato__: During planting time, place mature, unblemished, whole or halved Irish and sweet potatoes in seed soil, half in the soil, 1/2 to 1 inch apart. As leaves sprout, cover potatoes with soil to protect them from dirt. In mid summer, keep watering and adding mulch to protect them from insects.   - __Seeds__: Follow the instructions on the back of the seed packet and see Seed Starting Tips for suggestions on preparing seeds to germinate. Place seeds in the soil about the depth listed on the package. After 3 to 5 days, seeds begin to sprout and in one to two weeks afterward they can be started in an indoor greenhouse or larger area. Plants will need full sun for fastest growth. Once larger seedlings reach a foot high, sift the soil around the garden outside. After the seeds sprout, keep the soil constantly watered. In 5 to 10 days after sprouting first flowers, soil can be mulched with straw. Trickling or sprinkling plants supposedly improves flower color. In summer, when plants begin to age, plant seeds elsewhere, especially carrots in the shade of bushes or flowers.

As you get started, you'll experience the joys of watching seeds grow into vegetables. To begin successfully, make choices that fit your gardening style, space, and budget.\\n\\n## Planning Your Garden\\n*         Set goals for your garden.   Decide on a goal for your vegetable garden. A goal will help shape your garden plan. Ask yourself if your goal is to:         - Grow enough vegetables to help feed your family.     - Save money on groceries.     - Get children and teens interested in gardening.     - Enjoy time spent outdoors.     - Exercise during the time spent gardening.     \\t- Relax and relieve stress.       \\t- Share what you grow with neighbors, and friends.\\n*         Choose a garden site.   The right site can help make your garden successful. Think about the following factors when choosing a site:         - Sunlight. Most vegetables need at least 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. A sunny spot like a south-facing garden is best. If your garden will get some shade, it is important to choose shade-tolerant vegetables such as leaf lettuce, spinach, and Swiss chard.     - Water access. Vegetables need about one inch of rain or watering every week during the growing season. Be sure to choose a site with a convenient water source nearby for watering.     - Drainage. If a garden area has standing water after a rain, choose another garden site.       Check your soil. It is best to put your soil in order before starting a garden. Take a sample of the soil to your local cooperative extension office for testing. Soil testing can tell you if you have enough nutrients, such as nitrogen, or if your soil needs special treatment, such as lime, to help vegetables grow. Most county extension offices provide soil testing for a small fee. They also offer area-specific vegetable gardening advice. If this is not available in your area, try using an online search to find vegetable gardening advice. In your soil test request, be sure to ask for tests for pH, organic matter content, salt levels, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels.\\n*         Choose a garden size.   A small garden is best for a beginning gardener. It can be less of a chore, and there is often less weeding and watering to do. As you gain experience and find time for gardening, you can expand your garden or start another one.\\n\\n\\n## Caring for Your Garden\\n*         Prepare the soil.   1. Rake the top 3 to 4 inches of soil to break up clumps, remove rocks and weeds, and create a smooth surface.     2. Add organic matter such as compost, bark chips, or decayed leaves to your soil each year. Mix organic matter in as you shovel or rake to break it up. Organic matter will help vegetables grow by adding nutrients and moisture to the soil and helping drainage.  Check with your local nursery or garden center for compost or for organic matter suitable for your soil. Compost can turn food scraps into rich organic matter. Improve soil on empty garden space, if you have any.     3. Wet soil with water from sprinklers or a hose. Wet the soil if it is crumbly dry and sprinklers or hoses dry it out rather than wet it. It is easier to rake and shovel wet soil. If your soil is muddy when you touch it, it is too wet to work.     \\t- Soil test results may suggest what you should do to improve your soil.\\n*         Decide whether to use seeds or plants.   Decide whether to start your vegetables from seeds or plants. Seeds are less expensive than plants, but seeds take longer to grow. Also, seeds are often easier to find at the store. Plants are seedlings that have been started and grown by someone else. Choose seeds or plants carefully. Read seed packets or plant labels. Look at the pictures on seed packets to see how big the vegetable will grow. Look for packets or labels that say disease resistant if you are concerned about a certain disease. (Disease resistant means it is not likely to get that disease. )    If using seeds, choose seed packets with a 'packed for' date within the last year. Do not plant seeds from packets that are out of date. These seeds will not grow. Check that garden center plants are healthy, not wilted and yellow, or covered with insects. Healthy seedlings are usually about 6 inches tall and greening, not yellowing. They should not have too many roots growing out the bottom of the pot. This means the seedlings are well cared for and not crowded together in one pot.    When starting seeds indoors or outdoors, plants or seeds need warmth, moisture, and light to sprout and grow. Sometimes plants grow slowly, so check the seed packets or plant labels for gardening tips.  Also, some new gardeners find plants easier to grow than seeds.\\n*        \",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a vegetable garden can be a rewarding project!

{"prompt": "How do I start a vegetable garden What should I know?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Whether you plan to plant a small garden or just a few veggies in pots on your patio, youll want to get the most out of your gardening experience by learning a few fundamentals. This guide will help you get started on the right foot. Tips for garden planning and planting The following tips will help you select a site and prepare a garden plan that includes what to plant and how to plant it. It will help you get your plants off to a good start so they will thrive. Planning Where to Plant Sunlight: Choose a spot that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight each day. Most vegetables grow best with at least 6 hours of sunlight. Trees, shrubs, decks, and fences can shade garden areas. If you are planting near these things, you may want to observe how sunlight moves across those spots during the day. The goals is to find areas that get good sunlight for most of the day. Water:  A garden should be near a water source so you can easily keep the soil consistently moist. Also consider the amount of rainfall in your area, since that may affect your watering needs. Design and Size:  Start with a small garden and let it grow with your confidence. A garden that is too big can become overwhelming, especially for beginning gardeners. A small garden is easier to plant, maintain, and harvest. As you learn what to plant and how to grow, you can gradually expand your garden.   You can plant a bigger vegetable garden, a flower garden, or a combination. You can also grow flowers, herbs, and edible plants in containers. Container gardening may be best if you have limited space available, have poor soil, or don't want to spend the time to prepare a garden bed. It also gives you room to grow what you want, and possibly in unusual places. Gardening with Children: Gardening with children can be a fun family activity. Gardening teaches them about food and gives them a chance to explore nature. They learn by watching adults and by trying things themselves. If you'd like to include children in your gardening plans, please review the suggestions in the Gardening with Children section of this guide. When to Plant Seeds and Plants The time to plant seeds and plants depends mainly on your growing season. A growing season is the time between the last spring frost and the first fall frost when plants can grow. To know when to plant or transplant, you must know if the last frost date comes before, on, or after your planned planting date. To find the average last spring frost date and the first fall frost date in your area, ask your county Extension agent or look in gardening books, including the Vegetable Planting Calendar for home gardens. When the calendar says to plant, you can put seeds or plants in the soil or containers. The soil should be warm enough for seeds to germinate and for roots to grow. Check soil temperature to make sure it is warm enough for the seeds you plan to plant. In general, it is best to plant your seeds or plants when air temperatures will be 65 F to 75 F, and soil temperatures will be the same or a little warmer.      Seed packets provide information about a seeds germination temperature. If you have tomato seeds, for example, it will probably say tomato seeds germinate best in temperatures of 70 F to 90 F. Keeping soil moist will also help seeds germinate.

Here are some key points to consider, along with step-by-step instructions to help you prepare your garden and grow a bountiful crop.

Considerations for each type include what vegetables you want to grow, how often you will tend to your garden, and how much space you have.\\n\\n### Choose a Garden Site\\n\\n1. **Access to Sunlight**: Look for a spot that gets plenty of sunshine. Most vegetables need at least 6 hours of full sun each day (more is better).\\n2. **Access to Water**: Make sure there is a source of water nearby for when you need to water your garden.\\n3. **Soil and Drainage**: Check the soil and drainage in the area you have chosen. Vegetables prefer sandy or loamy soil. Good drainage is important or there is a risk that plants may rot. Also check the soil's pH. Most vegetables grow best when the soil's pH is between 6.0 and 7.0. You may read more details on testing your soil for pH in these links: understanding soil pH and soils and soil amendments.\\n4. **Protection**: A fence may be needed to protect your plants from animals, such as rabbits and deer. Space for walking paths is useful to prevent soil compaction in your garden, and between the rows of vegetables will give you easy access for harvesting.\\n\\n### Choosing Between Types of Gardens If you are new to vegetable gardening, it can be easier to start small, such as with a small plot of soil and a few vegetables. Small plots can make it easier to keep weeds under control and will require less maintenance. Once you feel comfortable growing vegetables, you can expand your garden.\\n\\nHere are common types of gardens to consider:\\n\\n1. **In-Ground Gardens**: Planting directly in your soil, also called \\\"pie-shaped gardens,\\\" is the easiest way to grow vegetables. The amount of sunlight, soil, and moisture determines the variety of vegetables you can grow in every season. You can use raised rows or create small hills (containing 2 or 3 plants) for easy watering and good drainage.\\n2. **Raised Bed Gardens**: A raised garden bed is a garden installed on top of the ground using soil that has been raised 6\\\" to 18\\\" in a frame, most often made of wood, bricks, blocks, or stones. Choose the size of your bed and make it no wider than 4'. This helps you easily reach every part of the bed to plant, water, and weed it. Length is less important; a longer bed can help facilitate crop rotation. Make sure the bed gets plenty of sunlight. It may be more work to maintain this type of garden, because extra soil is needed to fill the bed and watering will be necessary on hot days when the raised bed may dry out. Raised beds are usually great for people who like to garden because the elevated level makes it easier to reach, but they're not a solution if you want to avoid bending or kneeling. Keep the soil moist so there is extra energy for growing vegetables.\\n3. **Container Gardens**: Containers can be a creative alternative to in-ground gardens. Containers provide the advantage of being able to place them wherever you want them. They also can be easier for people needing to avoid kneeling or bending. Be sure your containers have holes in the base for drainage so that water does not build up in the soil and drown the plants' roots.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a vegetable garden can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. Here are some things you should consider and steps you should follow to start your own vegetable garden:\\n### **Planning Your Vegetable Garden**\\n1. **Choose a Location:** Find a site for the garden that has at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. The place doesn\u2019t have to be totally weed-free; killing weeds is an important early garden job and will help prevent them from coming back all season long. Select a site that has a water source nearby or plan to carry water. Look at how water drains in the area. A site that stays wet can drown your plants.\\n2. **Decide What to Grow:** When choosing vegetables, think about your favorites and what would grow well in your area. Be bold and try something new! Make sure to choose varieties suited for your growing season. Try to get seeds or plants that are disease resistant whenever possible. \\n3. **Make a Plan: **Think about how much of each vegetable you and your family will eat. If you plan to freeze or can extra for winter, you might want to plant a little more. You can use graph paper to lay out rows before you plant. Find out which plants can be planted next to each other and which plants do better separate. (These are called companion plants.)  \\n\\n### **Developing the Garden Site**\\n4. **Make the Soil:** Great gardens start with healthy soil. You want soil that is easy to work, and can keep moisture, and has nutrients. In your first year growing a garden start working on improving the soil. - Check your soil. You can use a soil test kit to look at the pH and nutrient levels in your soil. Or you can send a sample to a local soil-testing lab. You may have to change the soil based on the  test results. - Improve drainage in wet areas. If you find that water tends to puddle in some areas of the garden after it rains, dig compost or aged manure in at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) deep in these low areas to help water soak in and drain away more quickly. - Loosen the soil. Make sure to dig or till to loosen the soil. Remove weeds, rocks, and old roots or other debris. - Make flower, herb and vegetable beds. You can use tools and your hands to shape the garden beds in geometric or free shapes that are great to look at. If you are an older gardener or have trouble bending and kneeling, you may want to build raised garden beds. They are easy to reach; all plants can be picked without bending down. If you have to use a wheelchair, make raised garden beds that can be reached from the chair. To help keep weeding to a minimum, you can line the bottom of the garden bed with a layer of cardboard or newspaper. This will break down totally in the garden.\\n5. **Decide on a Garden Design: **Here are some common designs for a vegetable garden. - **Rows:* This is the most common and easiest way to plant seeds and seedlings. You plant seeds and seedlings in rows, usually with walking space between  the rows. This design works best if you're planting carrots, onions, and potatoes, and using a garden tiller. - **Raised Beds:** A raised bed garden is good for small spaces that get a lot of sunlight. You plant seeds and seedlings in gardens that are raised up above the ground, usually framed by wood, stone, or metal. Pyled soil in long, wide lumps and grouped seeds and seedlings together. If you plan to use a garden tiller, raised garden beds should be at least 16 inches wide so tilling is easier. - **Square Foot:** To make a square foot garden, the garden is often in a 4-foot (1.2-meter) square shape. This design is best for \\\"intensive gardening\\\" as small plants can be grown close together with little space between them. - **Container:** In a container garden, containers are usually above the ground. Anything that holds soil for healthy root growth is a possible container. Containers can be plastic pots, half barrels, window boxes, hanging pots, and anything else you can find. Make sure the grow containers have holes in the bottom for drainage and to keep the soil from washing out. Stack pots or containers up and down; you can also use vertical gardens where plants climb up supports made from wood or metal. - **Hills:** When you plant seeds and seedlings on or near the tops of rising ground in gently rolling shapes, seeds and seedlings that need drier soil will do better than if they are planted on the flat ground called \\\"valleys.\\\" Plants in hills also get extra sun and the benefit of cool winds. - **Twist garden:** You can plant some garden plants in a spiral around a mound of soil, called a \\\"twist garden.\\\" Tall plants go in\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

You've taken the first step toward creating a garden where good things grow, and a garden that is healthy for you and the world around you.\\n\\n\\n### Find a Good Location\\n\\nMost vegetables need at least six hours of sunlight a day. If you can't find a sunny spot, some vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, and other greens, may produce well with less sunlight. You want to make sure that the space you choose fits these basic requirements:\\n\\n- **Level, well-drained**: If water pools in low spots after a rain, it will not be absorbed by the plants you want to grow. If the area is also clay soil, full of weeds, rocky, or lacks nutrients, consider creating a raised-bed garden. A raised-bed garden is a small plot of soil that is raised above the surrounding soil. Sometimes it has wooden or stone sides to contain the soil. Soil in raised beds warms faster in the spring, drains better, and is easier to work.\\n- **Protect from wind**: If the area where you want to plant is windy, consider using a fence, evergreen hedge, or trellis to break the wind.\\n- **Near a water source**: You can set up a hose or soaker hose that can slowly release water onto the soil. A soaker hose runs on low pressure to moisten the top inch or so of soil without causing soil erosion.\\n\\n\\n### Choose Your Vegetables\\n\\nChoose vegetables that your family enjoys eating and that grow well in your area. Some vegetables are easy for new gardeners to grow. These include peppers, tomatoes, radishes, salad greens, carrots, and zucchini! You can write these vegetables down to keep track of them.   Consider choosing a few of the following types of vegetables:\\n\\n- **Leafy vegetables**: Lettuce, Swiss chard, spinach\\n- **Fruiting vegetables**: Tomato, zucchini, eggplant, bell pepper\\n- **Root vegetables**: Carrots, radishes, beets\\n- **Legumes**: Peas, beans\\n- **Flowering vegetables**: Potato, pumpkin, cucumber, squash, okra\\n\\nOnce you have selected your seeds or plants, read the information packet before planting. It tells you how much sunlight, water, and space the plant needs.\\n\\n\\n### Work the Soil\\n\\nSoil is made up of tiny pieces of minerals and rock, and of once-living things called organic matter. Organic matter makes up less than one fourth of most soils, but it is an important part. Organic matter helps with water drainage, air flow, and holds water and nutrients for plants. Compost is one of the best ways to add organic matter to soil.   If you are planting your garden in traditional rows, each row should be at least three feet apart. This gives plants enough space to grow wide and tall. If you want to plant in squares, plan for a square foot of space for each full-size tomato or cabbage. Space smaller and climbing plants every 12 inches. This will allow you to water, weed, and harvest without stepping on the soil, which makes it hard and dry. \\n\\n####  Preparing the Soil\\n\\n- Clear the area: To begin, remove all harmful plants. Use the hoe or shovel to dig and break up the soil. Trees and shrubs in nearby areas may send their roots into the garden space.\\n- Add nutrients: The soil in many home gardens doesn't have enough nutrients for plants to grow well. You should regularly add nutrients by mixing compost, rotted manure, or synthetic (human-made) fertilizers into the soil.\\n- Test the soil: Ask your local county extension office if they have a soil testing service. This will let you know what nutrients your soil has and what it lacks.\\n\\n\\n### Water on a Schedule\\n\\nWater helps seeds sprout and grow strong. When you first plant seeds or seedlings, be sure to water them well. An easy way to tell how much to water is to stick your finger into the soil near the plants. Depending on what type of soil you have and how hot and dry the weather is, your vegetable plants will need water every few days. Soil should feel damp, not dry or soggy. Warm sun and wind can dry out seedlings.\\n\\n\\n### Protect Your Plants\\n\\nEach vegetable has a pest that likes to eat it! Pests and diseases can spoil your harvest. You can help prevent problems by planting lots of different plants. For example, you could plant a group of carrots and then a group of radishes, instead of rows of only carrots or only radishes.   To stop the spread of insect pests and plant disease: Always wash your hands and gardening tools after working in the garden.   Talk to your county extension office or local gardening store for help in identifying pests and diseases.

This guide explains several steps to starting a freelance career.   ### 1. Identify Your Skills and Services  Think about what skills you have that could be useful to others, then determine what services you would like to offer. Your skills might include:  - Content writing or copywriting. - Graphic design. - Photography. - Accounting or bookkeeping. - Computer coding. - Marketing. - Consulting. - Training or tutoring.   Write down a list of any hard (technical) or soft (interpersonal) skills that could be useful for freelance work. Then research freelance services in your area of expertise to see what you are interested in offering.   ### 2. Build a Portfolio A portfolio helps you get clients by showcasing your work to potential customers. It should include examples of anything you plan to sell, whether that's articles, designs, photos, or something else. Think about whether you want your portfolio to be physical or digital or both.  Building a portfolio has many steps:    - If you do not yet have samples of your work, consider doing some projects for free or for reduced cost. This can help you build your portfolio and gain experience. - If you plan to write blog posts, start your own blog. - If you plan to write articles, consider writing for free for an online publication to get clips of your work. - Consider using free sites such as Behance for artwork or Dribbble for web design. - Choose work samples that reflect the services you want to sell the most. - Make your samples easy to access and view, with clear descriptions of the services you are offering.   ### 3. Choose a Business Structure Your business structure affects the taxes you pay and your level of risk. You may want to consult with a tax professional to choose which structure works best for you. Here are common business structures:    - Sole proprietorship: A business owned and operated by one person. There is no legal separation between the owner and the business. - Limited liability company (LLC): A separate legal entity that protects its owners (members) from being personally liable for some business debts or obligations. - Corporation: A legal entity that is separate from its owners and is responsible for its own debts.   ### 4. Create a Business Plan  A business plan will help you set goals and develop a direction for your freelance career. As a freelancer, your business plan acts like a guide for how you run your business. It includes the following sections:    -  Executive Summary. A one-page summary of your freelance business plan. This should be an overview of the full document. Use clear, short sentences. - Business Description. Write a clear description of your freelance work and what you hope to accomplish. - Market Research. Research your competition and identify your target market. - Marketing Plan. Decide how you will advertise your freelance services. - Financial Plan. Outline your financial goals and how you plan to reach them.      ### 5. Determine Your Pricing   Think about how much you need and want to charge for your freelance services. Setting your price too high or too low can limit your chances of getting clients. It's also common to be uncomfortable when it is time to discuss your pay. Consider the following tips:   - Research what others charge for similar services in your area to help you decide on a price. - Set your price based on your level of experience and the amount of money you hope to make from your work. - Consider the time needed to finish a project when setting your price. - Talk to peers and mentors in your industry about how they set their prices. - Once you start getting clients, track the time you spend finishing different project types. This can help you develop your pricing for the future.   ### 6. Register Your Freelance Business  Check with your local government about whether you will need to register your freelance business or file a \\\"Doing Business As\\\" (DBA) or fictitious name statement. You can usually get information about registration from your city or county clerk's office.   Some steps to registering your freelance business include:   - Choose a name for your freelance business. - Make sure the name you want to use is not already taken by checking online searches, a business name search website, or your local business registration office. - Check if you need special licenses or permits to operate your business. This depends on the type of work you do and where you work.   ### 7. Complete Taxes and Other Legal Actions  It is important to keep good records of your income and expenses so you can complete your taxes accurately. This includes saving receipts and invoices. If you earn enough income, you will have to pay self-employment taxes.    Once you start earning money, you may wish to consult with a tax professional or lawyer about your freelance business.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting to freelance can be an exciting venture!

Getting started doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming. Follow these steps to launch your career as a freelancer.\\n### Step 1: Choose what type of freelance work you will do\\nMake a list of your skills and strengths to help you think about what services you could offer to clients. Ask yourself: - **What are my hobbies and interests?** - **What would I enjoy doing for hours at a time?** - **What tasks have I done for work or school?** - **What do my friends and family ask me to help them with?** - **What would I do if I could do anything?**     Your freelance work can be based around any of your current skills or interests. Some common freelance jobs include: - Writing or editing - Graphic design - Website or app development - Photography - Social media management - Data entry or analysis - Marketing - Consulting     It may also help to look for something that already has a demand or that employers need more people to help them with.\\n### Step 2: Find freelance opportunities\\nOnce you have decided what type of freelance work you will do, look for opportunities: - **Network:** Let friends, family, and your community know that you want freelance work and the specific services you are offering. Communication helps get the word out, and you may be surprised by how many people are in need of your skills!   - **Freelance websites:** These are online services that help you connect with clients and send proposals. Some jobs you might find on these websites include graphic design, writing, and virtual assistance. Examples of freelance websites include Upwork and Fiverr.   - **Check local community boards:** Libraries, community centers, schools, and other local organizations often have digital or physical bulletin boards with flyers about free or low-cost services by freelancers. You can also add flyers about your freelance services and include your contact information so potential clients can reach out to you.   - **Create an online presence:** Consider building a professional website that shows off past work you have done or displays your resume and skills. This makes it easier for clients to find you online when they're looking for someone with your skills.\\n### Step 3: Assign a price to your services\\nSetting a price for your services need not be difficult. Consider the following: - **How much do I want to make?** Think about how many hours a week you want to work and how much money you want to make a week. Then divide your desired income by the hours you want to work that week. This equals the minimum hourly amount you will need to charge clients to reach that desired income. - **What does the job pay?** Look for similar work or job postings to see what competitors are charging for the same work. This can be your starting point.\\n### Step 4: Start finding clients\\nOnce you have set a price for your services, you can begin to find clients. Follow these suggestions: - When you find someone looking for help and you\u2019re interested, reach out with an introduction of yourself and your relevant experiences. - Create and regularly update an online portfolio with recent work samples that show off your skills.   - Once you have completed projects for clients, consider asking them for recommendations or testimonials that you can use to attract new clients in the future.   - If you\u2019re looking for a long-term freelance arrangement, consider developing a proposal that outlines how you can help meet a potential client\u2019s needs. Focus your proposal on former experiences that can help you have a successful relationship with client. Be specific about your skills and show how you plan to complete the work.     \\n### Step 5: Lessons learned\\nAs a freelancer, you will learn many things about yourself, the skills you have, and the tasks you can successfully complete. Early in your freelancing career, consider these questions and write down what you learn. Review your ideas after each job you take on. - What went well? - What did I learn that I want to remember next time? - What did not go so well, and what could I do differently?\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

When starting out as a freelancer, you should consider the following:   \\n\\n- **Identify skills you can use to earn money**: Think about your work history and education. Look for transferable skills you have used in other jobs that are also valuable to potential clients.   - Many freelancers are in the creative fields, such as photographers, writers, and graphic designers. However, you can freelance in almost any area, including accounting, programming, and project management. Consider making a list of all of your hard skills (specific and teachable) and soft skills (less tangible and harder to quantify, such as communication) that could be useful for freelance work.     - What services could you offer? For example, you might be able to provide virtual assistance or website development.\\n- **Build experience**: Once you know what skills you can be freelance, you may want to look for ways to develop your skills and build a portfolio.    - Consider volunteering your skills or working on small projects for friends or local businesses you want to work for eventually.     - Offer lower-than-market-rate services in exchange for new projects and the chance to learn.    - Take courses and attend events that allow you to practice your skills and meet potential clients and collaborators.    - Find a mentor who has freelanced before.\\n- **Set goals and priorities**: It can help to think about your priorities and what you hope to achieve as a new freelancer.    - Consider how much time you want to spend freelancing, and think about when you can devote that time.     - Decide whether you want to supplement your income with freelance work, or whether freelancing will be your main source of income.     - Set short-term and long-term goals for your freelance work. For example, you could set the goal of earning a certain amount of money in your first year. Think of concrete ways to reach that goal.\\n- **Think about finances**: Having a strong understanding of how to manage your finances will help you succeed as a freelancer. This includes knowing how to set your prices and manage inconsistent pay.    - Estimate how much money you hope to make as a freelancer, and decide how much you would like to make an hour or per project. (Consider what you would need to charge per hour or project in order to pay yourself a minimum wage.)    - Have a plan for your health insurance; find out if you can continue to use your current health insurance through a spouse or family member.     - Look for an accountant or financial coach who has experience with freelancers. Interested freelancers can also check with their local tax office about available resources.    - Spend less than you earn, to grow your savings.\\n- **Market your skills**: To find work as a freelancer, you will need to market and promote your skills and services.     - Create a simple website or online portfolio with samples of your work and information about the services you offer.    - Collect and showcase client testimonials.     - Network in person and online. Reach out to your personal and professional networks, letting them know what service you provide and what kinds of clients you want to work with.     - Carefully review online platforms that connect freelancers to clients. Be wary of scams that target freelancers.\\n- **Understand how to keep records**: Learn about this area and put systems in place to track record-keeping for your freelance income.    - Track your time and income carefully. Keep copies of invoices for your records. You might create a file on your computer for invoices and digital records, and you might also create paper records in a drawer or file box.     - Keep business-related expenses as separate as possible from your personal spending. You might want to set up a separate account at your bank for business expenses.    - Take organized notes about the details of payments and projects so that you have complete records to draw from in the future. This can also help if a client queries you on a project.\\n- **Establish a routine**: As a freelancer, it can help to find ways to set a daily schedule and stick to it as much as you can.   - Make a list of tasks you want to accomplish every week.\\n- **Look for mentors and sources of support**: You may find it useful to connect with and learn from others who have experience working as freelancers. You can also reach out to people who want to freelance in the same field.    - Consider searching for networking events in your area or local chapters of national organizations related to your skills or previous work.     - Look for groups and local services that offer opportunities for freelancers to support each other.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Starting a freelance career is an exciting venture that allows you to be your own boss and choose your clients and projects.

You're likely to enjoy the experience more as well if you're fit going into your marathon training. To determine your starting fitness, you can run for 30 minutes or set a goal to run a certain distance several times a week over the course of about a month. Aim to cover at least 20 miles a week. Keep these tips in mind as you get started.         -  Start with a plan. A wide variety of marathon-training plans are available. If you're a beginner, consider a program that includes a mix of short, mid-length and long runs. You'll probably start out slowly to gradually increase your distance and stamina, and then you'll have a recovery week about every three weeks. If you're a more experienced runner, you may want to train as you did for your last race or create a plan that focuses on your goals for your next marathon.    -  Build up slowly. Gradually increase the distance you're going. You can do this by increasing the distance of one run a week (usually the long run) or by increasing the total distance per week. For the long run, add about 1 mile (1.5 kilometers) a week. For your total distance, aim to increase your distance by about 10% each week.    -  Save the distance for long runs. Your chosen training plan should aim for a long run of about 18 to 26 miles (29 to 42 kilometers). But the weekly long runs should make up a small part of your overall training. Save the distance for this run. A good goal is to run a third as much as you plan to walk or run on marathon day the week before the marathon.    -  Mix speeds and distances. Mid-distance and long-distance runs should make up the bulk of your training. Add shorter, faster runs to your routine about once a week if you're more experienced. This might include some speed training, such as interval (repeated short distances with rest in between) or hill workouts. At the end of each week, also plan to take a day off from running.    -  Don't skip the taper. A taper involves cutting back on workouts for 3 weeks before your race to allow your body to recover from training. About 2 to 3 months before the marathon, plan your taper to fall about 2 weeks before the marathon.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Here are some key guidelines to help you train effectively for a marathon:\\n\\n1. **Build a Base of Running**: Before starting a marathon training plan, you should be able to comfortably run for 30 minutes at a time. It\u2019s also a good idea to have a base of running 15\u201320 miles (24\u201332 kilometers) per week for at least a month.\\n\\n2. **Choose a Training Plan**: Choose a marathon training plan that meets your current fitness level. Most marathon training plans are 16\u201320 weeks long and include a mix of easy runs, long runs, speed training, and rest days. Some may include a mid-length run, such as a 10K (6.2 miles), halfway into the plan. Beginners may benefit from plans that include more rest days and easy-running days because they will need those days to recover. People training for their second marathon may benefit more from a plan that focuses on faster pace runs.\\n\\n3. **Schedule Key Workouts**: Schedule your runs for the week, including:\\n    - **Long Run**: Run once a week or once every two weeks at a comfortable, easy pace. Increase the distance of one run each week (or every two weeks) by 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) until you reach 18\u201322 miles (29\u201335 kilometers). After the long run, do not increase the distance of that run for at least three weeks. You may want to practice your marathon pace and/or the food and drink you plan to use during the marathon on some of these long runs. \\n    - **Speed Training**: Do speed training once or twice a week at a track or flat, measured place (like a road or path). Include tempo runs (stretch of running faster than your normal pace), interval runs (short, fast runs followed by equal or longer time periods of slow jogging or walking), or hill training (running up hills, then walking or jogging back down). These runs should come after you are warmed up and should be followed by a cool-down.\\n    - **Easy Run**: Run at a relaxed pace for a short distance (three to five miles). These runs give your body a chance to recover from your long run and speed training. \\n    - **Rest Days**: Rest days are just as important to your training plan as the running workouts! Rest gives your muscles time to repair and helps you avoid injury. You may also want to cross-train on some rest days with low-impact activities such as walking, swimming, or cycling to help build strength.\\n\\n4. **Practice Eating and Drinking while Running**: During your training runs, practice eating and drinking the food and fluids that you plan to use during the marathon run. Drinking plain water is enough for runs shorter than 60 minutes. For longer runs, including marathon training runs, you need to drink enough fluids (sports drinks or plain water) to replace the water and sodium lost in sweat. You should practice drinking small amounts of fluids often during long runs.\\n\\n5. **Get the Right Gear**: Running shoes and clothing can affect how you feel during and after your runs. Choose lightweight clothing that wick moisture away and cool, comfortable shoes with low or moderate cushioning. If you typically wear special shoes or clothing (such as wearing a knee or ankle brace), you should plan to wear them during the marathon run, too.\\n\\n6. **Taper before the Marathon**: In the last three weeks of your training plan, gradually cut back on the number of days you run and the miles you run. Your last long run will be three weeks before the marathon. Rest during this time to allow your muscles to heal so you are ready for the marathon.\\n\\n7. **Get Ready for Race Day**: For the best marathon experience:\\n    - Set a goal (or two) for your marathon time and pace.\\n    - Think about how you will deal with challenges that may come up during the training and marathon run.\\n    - Look up information about the marathon and the course (elevation, area attractions, and traffic). \\n    - Schedule when you will do trainings and make travel and family plans that do not conflict with those times. \\n    - Figure out how you will get to the start line on the day of the marathon.\\n\\n8. **Stay Healthy While Training**: To safely work toward your marathon goal:\\n    - Train at your own fitness level.\\n    - Talk to your doctor before starting your training plan, especially if you are older than 40 or do not currently exercise regularly.\\n    - Avoid fast weight loss. Being about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight will not stop you from finishing your marathon.\\n    - Take a day off if you feel tired or sick, or if something hurts.\\n    - Avoid having\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Training for a marathon requires dedication, planning, and a commitment to gradually increasing both your running ability and endurance to successfully finish a 26.2-mile race.

The key to a successful race day is consistent training and gradually building up the time you spend running each week. Here are some tips on how to get started: \\n\\n### Prepare your body for marathon training\\n- Check with your doctor. If you are planning to begin a new exercise program, it is always a good idea to check with your doctor or health care provider, especially if you have a history of heart disease, lung disease or have any leg, hip or back problems.\\n- Start with a walk/run program. If you are new to regular exercise or have not run regularly in the past six months, follow a walk/run program to get ready for marathon training. Plan to walk for 1 hour at least 2 times a week. After 1 week, add in some slow running. To do this, choose a time to run and sample the following program:\\n\\n    | Week     | Minutes walking      | Minutes running    | Total time |\\n    |----------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------|\\n    | 1        | 30                     | 5            | 35          |\\n    | 2        | 25                      | 10           | 35          |\\n    | 3        | 20                      | 15           | 35          |\\n    | 4        | 15                      | 20           | 35          |\\n    | 5        | 10                      | 25           | 35          |\\n    | 6        | 5                     | 30                    | 35          |\\n    \\n\\n### Create a training plan\\n- Choose a method that works for you. Whether you are a beginner who is looking to complete her first marathon or a seasoned athlete who wants to improve her marathon time, choosing a good training plan is key. Use the training plan that a coach or experienced runner suggests and fits your life.\\n- Start slow and build up. If you are not currently participating in regular long-distance exercise, consider a 16- to 20-week training program.\\n\\n### Learn how to train for a marathon\\n- Build your long, slow distance (LSD) workout. Each week, set aside one long, slow distance day to run. Follow the training plan you chose for how many miles to run each week. Do not run more than 13 miles (or 20% of your goal race distance) for your weekly long distance day in your first month of marathon training. After that, build the distance by no more than 1 mile a week to safely increase your stamina. Each month, take a break from increasing your maximum long run distance by shortening it by 20% to 50%.\\n- Add speed workouts slowly. Most training plans that get you ready for a marathon will have speed workouts or hill workouts 1 day a week to help build up your strength and stamina. You will need to include time for a rest day to keep tone your muscles from the strain of running.\\n    * The goal of a speed workout is to improve your heart and lung fitness (aerobic capacity). These workouts are usually done once your weekly long, slow distance workout has been established. Fit speed workouts in at least 3 of the weeks in the 6 weeks leading up to 3 race day. Speed workouts may be 400-meters (or slight longer or shorter based on your interest) done on a track. You should rest as long as each 400-m workout takes. Blend longer runs with a few speed workouts at about 5K race pace.\\n        \\n    * The goal of a hill workout is to strengthen your leg muscles. Include 1 to 3 times a week of running or walking up an incline on a treadmill, using a hill workout app or find a real hill. About 6 weeks before the race day, do a series of 150-m (or slightly longer) hill sprints. If needed, equal the height of a 150-m uphill run by running longer if the hill you find is too short. Plan to rest for at least equal the time you took to do the run. \\n    \\n### Get the right gear\\n- Choose good shoes. Go to a store that specializes in running shoes. Explain your fitness goals to the sales staff or a coach. They will help you choose shoes based on your foot and running style. Plan to buy new shoes every 300-400 miles (480-640 kilometers you will train). If you train 4 days a week, buy a new pair of shoes every 3 months.\\n- Buy comfy workout clothes. Choose workout clothes made of synthetic materials that whisk sweat away from your body. This will help you avoid heat illness. Make sure your clothes fit right and allow you to move freely. Look for workout clothes with reflective materials so you can stay safe if you run before sunrise or after sunset. Do test runs in your new workout clothes and shoes.\\n    \\n### Cross Train\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Key steps in training for a marathon include gradually increasing your mileage and sticking to a training plan.

A typical plan begins by gradually increasing the distance you run, starting at 5 to 10 miles. The program goal should be 3 to 7 miles, depending on your level of fitness. You may want to include some of the shorter, fast runs recommended above. For training runs, aim to have at least two complete breaks (no running) each week.\\n                                                       \\n                                                        Pick a race\\n                                                        Once you have established a training plan, you can begin training for a marathon by selecting the marathon you want to run. Most marathons are supported by local race directors who organize pre-race activities, such as announcements, promotional events, and pre-race dinners. Select a local marathon if possible, and look for one that is sponsored by a reputable race director. The location of the race and local weather during the time of year the marathon is held can greatly affect your experience and performance.\\n                                                       \\n                                                        Start in stages\\n                                                        If you are training for your first marathon, you may want to start with shorter training sessions. It can also be helpful to map your running route several days in advance. You can look for shorter distances if you're concerned about the exact path of your run. Even if you meet the distance set by your marathon, it is important that you gradually increase your mileage over the course of the training plan. If you are also training for other marathons during the year, try not to run them too closely together. Instead, schedule one marathon about every 16 weeks. You might even consider adjusting your training schedule throughout the year based on your weekly and monthly running rates.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Before you begin any exercise program you should talk to your doctor about your fitness and health history. If you are currently sedentary, a gradual increase in your activity level is often a good first step before beginning formal training. You may want to consider signing up for a beginner or low-intensity exercise program in your community or at a local gym to help jump-start your training.   One way to increase your activity level is to plan for a special event such as a road race. Several months of training will prepare you to run a half marathon. If you are a complete novice, a half marathon may be an ambitious goal. You may want to consider starting with a shorter race, such as a 5K (3.1-mile) or a 10K (6.2-mile) race. If you are interested in a 5K, you may want to check out the information on running a 5K.   If you have run a little or done some jogging in the past and have been totally sedentary, you should allow six months or more to train for a half marathon. If you have been exercising and walking for a total of 30 minutes a day for at least four weeks, you may be ready to run a half marathon in four to five months.    Marathon training programs range in length from 14 to 20 weeks.   * If you are a repeat marathon runner, it is best to use a marathon training program designed for repeat runners.   * If you have never run a marathon before, look into programs especially for first-time marathoners. These programs guide you through your running workouts and help you build stamina and stay healthy while you train. You will learn how to maintain your energy, fluids, and foods on race day.   * If you have run a marathon before, look into marathon programs for intermediate or advanced capacity runners. These programs help you improve your running and teach you how to listen to your body, stay healthy during workouts, and gradually build up to your marathon.   To help get started, you'll need to do the following:   1.  Implement your training program.   2.  Choose your marathon.   3.

Assess Your Current Fitness Level\\nBefore starting a marathon training program, consider your current running ability and experience. You should be comfortable running a minimum of 15-20 miles per week. If you are new to running or have been inactive, consider starting with a shorter race, like a half-marathon, first.\\n\\n### 2. Create a Training Plan\\nA typical marathon training plan lasts 16-20 weeks and includes a mix of:\\n- **Long runs**: Help build endurance. These are done once a week, and the distance gradually increases.\\n- **Shorter runs**: Can be done at an easy, conversational pace or a faster pace.\\n- **Speed work**: Interval training or tempo runs to improve your speed and running economy.\\n- **Rest days**: Allow your body to recover and adapt.\\n\\n### 3. Build Mileage Gradually\\nIncrease your total weekly mileage gradually (no more than 10% per week). This helps prevent injuries. Alternate between weeks of increasing mileage and recovery weeks where you reduce your mileage.\\n\\n### 4. Incorporate Cross-Training\\nEngage in activities like swimming, cycling, or strength training on your non-running days to improve overall fitness and reduce the risk of injury.\\n\\n### 5. Pay Attention to Nutrition\\n- **Carbohydrates**: They provide energy for running. Incorporate whole grains, fruits, and vegetables into your diet.\\n- **Proteins**: Important for muscle repair and recovery. Include lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and legumes.\\n- **Fats**: Healthy fats are essential but should be consumed in moderation.\\n- Stay hydrated and learn to drink water or sports drinks during your long runs.\\n\\n### 6. Practice Race Day Conditions\\nUse your long training runs to practice what you'll do on race day:\\n- Shoe choice and clothing\\n- Nutrition and hydration strategies\\n- Running pace\\n\\n### 7.

It's important to approach marathon training with a clear plan and the understanding that it will require a significant commitment of time and energy. Here's a general guide to help you prepare:\\n\\n### 1. Assess Your Fitness Level\\nBefore you start training, you should be able to run or walk for at least 30 minutes a few times a week. If you're starting from a lower fitness level or have not been regularly active, consider building your base fitness first.\\n\\n### 2. Create a Training Plan\\nA typical marathon training plan is 16 to 20 weeks long, depending on your current running ability. Include the following key components:\\n\\n- **Long Runs**: These increase your endurance. Start with a long run of about 5-6 miles and gradually increase the distance each week, peaking at 18-22 miles before tapering down before the race.\\n  \\n- **Weekly Mileage**: Gradually increase your total weekly mileage. A common rule is to increase your running volume by no more than 10% per week.\\n  \\n- **Rest Days**: Take at least one or two rest days each week to allow your body to recover.\\n  \\n- **Cross-Training**: Incorporate other forms of exercise, such as cycling, swimming, or yoga, to improve your overall fitness and reduce the risk of injury.\\n  \\n- **Tapering**: Gradually reduce your mileage in the last 2-3 weeks before the marathon to allow your body to recover and be at peak condition on race day.\\n\\n### 3. Incorporate Different Types of Runs\\n- **Easy Runs**: Comfortable pace; allows for conversation.\\n- **Long Runs**: As mentioned, done at a slower pace to build endurance.\\n- **Tempo Runs**: Start with an easy jog, then increase speed to a \\\"comfortably hard\\\" pace, and finish with an easy jog.\\n- **Interval Training**: Alternate short bursts of speed with periods of slower running or walking to improve speed and endurance.\\n\\n### 4. Practice Nutrition and Hydration\\n- **During Training**: Determine what types of food and drinks work best for you during your long runs. Experiment with energy gels, chews, or other sources of carbohydrates.\\n- **Pre-Race Eating**: Before your long runs and the marathon, have a familiar meal to see how your body reacts.\\n\\n### 5. Choose Gear Wisely\\n- **Shoes**: Invest in a good pair of running shoes. Get fitted at a specialty running store if possible. Break them in during training rather than starting to wear them on race day.\\n- **Clothing**: Wear moisture-wicking and comfortable clothing.\\n\\n### 6. Listen to Your Body\\nPay attention to your body throughout training. If you feel pain that doesn't improve with rest, consult a medical professional. Injuries can occur if you increase your mileage too quickly or don\u2019t allow enough recovery.\\n\\n### 7. Prepare for Race Day\\n- **Know the Course**: Familiarize yourself with the marathon course, including aid stations and terrain.\\n- **Sleep**: Get plenty of rest the week before the race, especially the night before.\\n- **Pacing**: Start at a comfortable pace, especially in the first half of the race.\\n\\n### 8. Enjoy the Process\\nMarathon training can be a fulfilling experience.

{"prompt": "How do I train for a marathon What should I know?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"You can train for a marathon by gradually increasing your long runs, mixing in some speed work, and gradually increasing your weekly mileage. For the best results, begin training for your marathon about 16 to 20 weeks before the race. This will give you time to build stamina without risking an injury. If you are a beginner, choose a marathon training plan that is designed for beginners.\\nTraining plans can vary considerably, so be sure to choose a plan that fits your current fitness level and speed. You can work with a coach, join a running group, or create your own training plan. You can also use a marathon training app, a website with a marathon training calculator, or just follow the plan below. If you are a beginner or do not run regularly, you may want to talk to your doctor or a sports medicine doctor before starting this training plan.\\nAlthough regular, consistent training and practicing your racing skills will prepare you for a marathon, following a training plan will help you stay injury-free and shave time off your marathon. Your training plan should include the following components:\\n- Your long run, to help you build stamina. This run should increase by no more than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) each week until you reach your desired running distance (usually no more than 20 miles [32 kilometers]). For example, a long run every other week of 2, 4, 6, and 8 miles (3.2, 6.4, 9.7, and 12.9 kilometers) and then every other week 10, 11, 12 and 13 miles (16.1, 17.7, 19.3, and 20.9 kilometers) is a good plan. Long runs can also be spread throughout the week. For example if your goal is a total of 20 miles (32 kilometers), on Monday you would run 4 miles (6.4 kilometers), Tuesday you would do 3 miles (4.8 kilometers), Wednesday you would rest, Thursday you would do 4 miles (6.4 kilometers), Friday you would rest, Saturday you would do 4 miles (6.4 kilometers), and Sunday you would do 5 miles (8 kilometers). Keep the average of your weekly long run to no more than 7 miles (11 kilometers) until you reach the desired long run distance. Or, if you will do a 20-mile (32-kilometer) long run every week, run no more than about 20 miles (32 kilometers) total each week except on long run weeks.\\n- A speed session, usually done once a week, may include a tempo run, interval run, or hill repeats. These workouts may help you run at a faster pace while using less energy. This will improve your stamina for the marathon. A tempo run is an easy warmup followed by running for a set time (for example, 40 minutes). Later in your training for the marathon, you can switch it so that in one workout you do 25 minutes of running, easier for 5 minutes, and then 25 more minutes. An interval run is generally a set distance (for example, 5 miles [8 kilometers]) at a faster than normal pace, with a couple of minute break in between to rest and stretch. Hill repeats are running up a hill over a set distance (for example, 1 mile [1.6 kilometers]). Once you reach the top, jog or walk the distance back down. Repeat.\\n- 4 mmile (6.4 kilometer) Easy runs done at an easy, comfortable pace can be done several times throughout the week. These will also help you build stamina.\\n-  Days of rest at least once a week to allow your muscles time to repair themselves will help you avoid injuries and run your best on race day.\\n  - On these days do yoga, swim, bike, or do other exercises that are easy on your body. Do not run.\\n  - Or take at least 1 day off each week. This means to not run at all.\\n  - Be careful not to start running again too quickly. If you stop feeling sore in your leg muscles, but your lower back still hurts a little, you may need to rest those tired lower back muscles more before running again.\\n- Gradually increase your weekly mileage to build up your stamina. Do so no more than 10 percent each week to decrease your risk of injury.\\n- Taper before your marathon in the final 2 to 3 weeks. Start reducing your long runs and weekly mileage so that your body can take a rest. This will help you avoid fatigue and arrive at the starting line feeling fresh.\\n\\n### Nutrition and hydration\\nYou can help your body prepare for the marathon by carefully planning your diet. Your diet, especially in the weeks leading up to your marathon, can help strengthen your body's stores of glycogen and iron.

A marathon (26.2 miles) is a race of endurance. Your body will need to train for the long-distance running and your mind will need to learn how to endure the discomfort and stress of the race. To train effectively and reduce the risk of injury, you will need to follow a training plan that works for you. It is best to work around your schedule and take into account your other commitments and abilities. Training also includes confidence-building practices that help prepare you mentally. This includes making sure your nutrition, hydration, and other pre-race and race-day needs are met.\\n                   \\n                \\n                    Training considerations\\n                    Understand your current level of fitness. Training for a marathon is not recommended for beginning runners. It is best to have experience running 10 km (6.2 miles) or longer distances before training for a marathon. Marathon training is physically and mentally demanding. To train safely, it is advised that you build a solid running base first. This should include a consistent and fairly high weekly mileage, such as an average of 15 miles a week for at least a month.                                                                                 This page focuses on tips for training safely, a training plan to increase your running distance, nutrition and hydration guidelines, what to expect in the days leading up to the marathon race, and how to prepare for race day.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Tips for training safely\\n                    -  Consult your doctor. Before starting any new exercise program, including training for a marathon, contact your healthcare provider. Older adults and people with certain medical conditions should talk with their healthcare provider about the risks of starting a new exercise program.    -  Choose the right shoes and gear. Choose well-fitting shoes and comfortable clothes that are made for long distance running. Find running shoes that fit well, provide good support, and match your gait and foot shape. Buy shoes at least two months before the race so you have enough time to find the right pair and break them in. Do not wear new shoes on race day. Plan some of your long runs wearing the gear you intend to use on race day, to make sure it is comfortable and does not cause skin irritation. You may also want to choose a specific running outfit (shirt and shorts, or whatever you plan to wear) for your marathon. Some marathon runners have special outfits they wear for each race.    - Caution with weather. Cold temperatures are not a barrier to safe outdoor exercise. Dress for the weather, and keep runs outside as long as it is safe (for example, it is best to avoid icy sidewalks). Do not train outside if thunder and lightning threatens your area. Learn to recognize the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke in hot weather. If the heat index is high or if the air quality is unhealthy, consider training indoors. In hot or cold weather, be sure to dress in layers and to hydrate (drink fluids).     -  Hydrate and fuel your body properly. Follow good nutrition and meal planning guidelines, especially for meals around when you run. Start with a good breakfast, and choose snacks for mid-morning and midday meals to keep your energy level up. Snacks can include yogurt, nuts, or healthy granola or protein bars. For your longer practice runs, aim to feed your body about every hour. For example, you may want to eat small snacks that are made up mostly of carbohydrates (the main fuel your body uses). Good options can include energy or food bars with carbohydrates that do not include fat, protein, or fiber. Try to avoid eating what causes stomach cramps (some runners find fibrous fruits and vegetables, oat bran, and protein bars can cause gas).     -  Practice good nutrition and meal planning. Stay hydrated. Drink water during short runs and sport drinks for electrolyte replacement for longer runs. Be careful not to drink more water than your body can handle. This can cause a rare but serious condition called hyponatremia, where an electrolyte in your body called sodium is diluted. Sodium helps regulate bodily fluids, and low levels can cause cramps, nausea, and confusion. Some athletes at a high risk of hyponatremia are those who train intensely and drink large amounts of water.    - Follow a well-planned training program. Training too hard or too long and too soon increases your chance for overuse injuries like stress fractures, shin splints, tendinitis, and plantar fasciitis (pain on the bottom of the foot). Follow a training program that fits your abilities. Avoid increasing the total distance you run by more than 10-20% a week. Programs that allow you to run several shorter runs each week while gradually building up your endurance tend to be effective and safer than a program that involves mostly long weekly runs.         -Plan walks or days off. Plan regular rest days in your weekly schedule.

This involves gradually building up your running distance and endurance. Here are steps and tips to help you successfully prepare for a marathon:\\n\\n### 1. Assess Your Current Fitness Level\\n- **Base Running**: If you aren't already running regularly, it's best to establish a base of running for at least a few weeks or up to a couple of months before beginning marathon training. Aim to be able to comfortably run for at least 30 minutes several times a week.\\n- **Short Race**: Consider running a 5K (3.1 miles) or 10K (6.2 miles) race to prepare for the marathon.\\n\\n### 2. Choose a Marathon\\n- Select a marathon that allows you enough time to train. Most novice marathoners take about 16 to 20 weeks to prepare.\\n\\n### 3. Create a Training Plan\\nA training plan typically includes:\\n- **Duration**: 16-20 weeks, depending on your current fitness level.\\n- **Mileage**: Gradually increasing weekly mileage with a maximum long run of 18-20 miles.\\n- **Long Runs**: Weekly long runs, typically on weekends, that start at around 6 miles and gradually increase to 18-20 miles.\\n- **Rest Days**: At least one rest day a week to allow your body to recover.\\n- **Cross-Training**: Activities like cycling, swimming, or strength training on non-running days to improve fitness and reduce the risk of injury.\\n\\n### 4. Follow a Training Schedule\\nYou can find many free marathon training schedules online, or you might consider following a structured program from a running club or a coach. A basic 20-week schedule might look like this:\\n\\n#### Example Weekly Schedule\\n- **Monday**: Rest or cross-training\\n- **Tuesday**: Short run (3-5 miles)\\n- **Wednesday**: Mid-length run (5-8 miles) - Easy pace\\n- **Thursday**: Short run (3-5 miles) + strength training\\n- **Friday**: Rest\\n- **Saturday**: Long run (starting at 6 miles, building to 18-20 miles)\\n- **Sunday**: Recovery run (2-4 miles) or cross-training\\n\\n### 5. Consider Your Nutrition\\n- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your runs.\\n- **Balanced Diet**: Eat a healthy mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\\n- **Race Day Nutrition**: Practice eating and drinking what you plan to consume on race day during your long runs.\\n\\n### 6. Prepare for Race Day\\n- **Taper**: Reduce your mileage for the last 2-3 weeks before the marathon to allow your body to recover and store energy.\\n- **Gear**: Train in the shoes and clothing you plan to wear on race day.\\n- **Logistics**: Plan how you will get to the marathon and where you will stay.\\n\\n### 7. Run the Marathon\\n- **Pacing**: Start slow to conserve energy for later miles.\\n- **Hydration and Nutrition**: Drink and eat as practiced during training.\\n- **Enjoy the Experience**: Take time to enjoy the crowds, scenery, and accomplishment.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nTraining for a marathon requires commitment and planning, but the sense of achievement you get from finishing a marathon makes it worthwhile.

Plans usually range from 12 to 20 weeks and include different paces and distances. Choose a plan that fits your current fitness level, experience, and schedule.\\n\\n### 2. Build a Base\\nBefore starting a marathon training plan, ensure you have a solid running base. This typically means being comfortable running a total of about 15-20 miles per week for several weeks.\\n\\n### 3. Weekly Structure\\nMost training plans include the following types of workouts:\\n- **Long Runs**: Run longer than your last long run, gradually reaching 18-20 miles.\\n- **Easy Runs**: Run at a conversational pace for recovery.\\n- **Tempo Runs**: Include segments at a faster, sustained pace to improve speed and efficiency.\\n- **Speed Work**: Intervals or hill workouts to build strength and speed.\\n- **Rest Days**: Time off from running to allow recovery.\\n- **Cross-Training**: Non-running activities (like cycling, swimming, or yoga) on some days for overall fitness.\\n\\n### 4.

Gear Up\\n- Invest in a good pair of running shoes that fit well and provide support.\\n- Wear moisture-wicking clothes for comfort and to prevent chafing.\\n- Gear for long runs should include gels, chews, or other easily digestible fuels.\\n\\n### 6. Listen to Your Body\\nPay attention to any signs of injury or excessive fatigue. If something hurts, consider taking a break or cutting back on the intensity or distance of your runs.\\n\\n### 7. Prepare Mentally\\nVisualize yourself running strong and finishing the marathon. Develop mental strategies to cope with discomfort during the race.\\n\\n### 8. Taper Before the Race\\nReduce your training volume in the last 2-3 weeks before the marathon. This helps your body recover and store glycogen for the race.\\n\\n### 9. Race Day Strategy\\n- **Pacing**: Start at a comfortable pace; don\u2019t run too fast too early.\\n- **Nutrition**: Stick to familiar pre-race meals; plan when and what to eat during the race.\\n- **Hydration**: Drink at regular intervals; don\u2019t wait until you're thirsty.\\n\\n### 10. Post-Marathon Recovery\\nAfter the marathon, take time to recover with rest days and gradually ease back into your normal routine.\\n\\nFollowing these guidelines will help you prepare your body and mind for the marathon distance.

If you're sending your cover letter by email or through an applicant tracking system, you may not need to include your address.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```\\nYour Name\\nYour Address\\nCity, State Zip\\nYour Email\\nYour Phone Number\\n[Date]\\n\\nEmployer Name\\nCompany Name\\nCompany Address\\nCity, State Zip\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Write a Greeting\\nAddress the cover letter to the hiring manager by name if you can find it. If you're unsure who that is, \\\"Dear Hiring Manager\\\" or \\\"Dear [Company Name] Team works.\\\" If you want to personalize your greeting even more, mention the company's name or a recent company event.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```\\nDear Ms. Smith,\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Introduce Yourself\\nYour introduction should include: \\n- The job title you're applying for.\\n- A brief (one or two sentence) overview of why you're qualified for the job.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```\\nI am writing to apply for the Marketing Coordinator position listed on Indeed.com. With a bachelor's degree in marketing and two years of experience coordinating marketing projects, I am confident that my skills and enthusiasm will contribute to the success of ABC Company.\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Explain Why You're a Good Fit\\nIn one or two paragraphs, explain why you're a good fit for the job. Focus on your skills and experience rather than repeating what's in your resume. Mention projects where you've shown your skills, relevant volunteer work, or awards you've received.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```\\nAt my current job at XYZ Company, I have coordinated marketing initiatives that have resulted in an increase in customer engagement. For instance, I developed a social media campaign that boosted our online sales by 25%. I also coordinate our annual trade show exhibit, creating the booth display and marketing materials, and managing logistics to ensure a successful event.\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Explain Why You're Excited About the Job\\nEmployers want to see enthusiasm for their company. Share why you're excited about the job and how you will add value. If the company has a mission statement, you might mention it in your letter.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```\\nI admire ABC Company's commitment to innovation and sustainability. I am particularly impressed by your recent launch of the Eco-Friendly Marketing Initiative. I would love the opportunity to contribute to this initiative by using my skills in project coordination and digital marketing.\\n```\\n\\n### Step 6: Conclude\\nIn your conclusion, thank the employer, and express interest in discussing the position. Be sure to include a follow-up statement.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```\\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail. I plan to follow up next week to see if we can arrange a time to talk.\\n```\\n\\n### Step 7: Sign Off\\nUse a professional closing like \u201cSincerely\u201d or \u201cBest regards.\u201d If you're sending a hard copy, leave space for your signature, then type your name.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```\\nSincerely,\\nJohn Doe\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Tips:\\n- **Tailor each cover letter.** Customize your letter for each job application. Use keywords from the job description and research the company to align your letter with the company's goals and values.\\n- **Keep it concise.** Your letter should be one page. Use short paragraphs and bullet points if they help convey your message clearly.\\n- **Proofread.** Spelling or grammar mistakes can make a bad impression.

A carefully considered cover letter can help you make a strong case for being invited for an interview. Below is a guide that outlines each step.\\n\\n### 1. Formatting the Cover Letter\\nYour cover letter should be written in formal business letter format. Here\u2019s how:\\n- **Your Address**: In the top left corner, write your address. Do not include your name here. \\n- **Date**: Write the date below your address.\\n- **Employer's Address**: Write the employer's address below the date, including the name of the person you are writing to (if you have it).\\n- **Salutation**: Start your letter with \\\"Dear [Hiring Manager's Name].\\\" If you do not have a name, use \\\"Dear Hiring Manager\\\" or \\\"Dear [Company Name] Team.\\\"\\n- **Body**: This is the main part of your letter, where you communicate your interest and qualifications.\\n- **Closing**: Use a professional closing like \\\"Sincerely\\\" or \\\"Best regards\\\", followed by a comma, then leave a few lines of space for your signature (if you're sending a hard copy) and type your name.\\n\\n\\n### 2. Writing the Introduction\\nIn your opening paragraph, mention the position you are applying for and how you found out about it. Clearly state your interest in the job and the company.  For example:\\n\\\"I am writing to apply for the Marketing Coordinator position at XYZ Company as advertised on your careers page. With a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Marketing and over three years of practical experience in the marketing field, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.\\\"\\n\\n### 3. Body Paragraphs\\nUse one or two paragraphs to explain why you are particularly suited for the position. Use specific examples from your experience to illustrate your points. Here are a few tips:\\n- **Match Your Skills**: Look at the job description. What skills or experiences is the employer looking for? Match those in your cover letter.\\n- **Show Personality**: You want to provide examples of your accomplishments, but you also want to show your personality and enthusiasm. \\n- **Be Specific**: Use specific examples and numbers to illustrate what you've done.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you.\\\"\\n\\n### 5.

It's about taking an idea and bringing it to life through your imagination and insight. It's also about planning, writing, and rewriting. Writing a novel is a big job, but if you break it into smaller tasks, you can do it. Create a writing routine, put aside your doubts, and follow the steps below to write your novel. \\n## Define your writing process.\\nThere are many different ways to write a novel. You will want to experiment and find what works best for you. Think about the following elements of a good writing process: * **Outlining**: Some novels are carefully planned from beginning to end, while others are written without much planning. Think about how much you want to plan your novel.   * **The first draft**: Novels often change a lot from the first draft to the last draft. Think about how you want to write your first draft.   * **Revising**: Some writers like to put their drafts away for a little while (at least a few days) before revising them, so they can see their drafts with fresh eyes. Think about when you want to start revising your draft.   * **Feedback**: You might want to share drafts of your novel with family, friends, or writing groups. Think about how you will keep yourself open to feedback while still staying true to your own creative vision.\\n## Pick a genre.\\nA genre is a type of story. Each genre has its own special features. Novels are often divided into three large genres: fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. Fiction tells a story about made-up characters and events. Nonfiction tells the true story of real people and events. Poetry is written in special forms, often using rhythm and rhyme to express feelings or ideas. Each of these large genres can be divided into smaller genres. For example, fiction includes genres like romantic comedy, science fiction, fantasy, detective, historical, and horror. Nonfiction includes genres like memoir, biography, essay, and self-help.\\n## Explore ideas and choose one.\\nThe best writing ideas come from your life and the lives of people around you. Search your memories and your thoughts for an idea that excites you. You can begin with the following questions: * What have I always wanted to write about? (For example, a person, experience, or event that matters to me.) * What am I really interested in? (For example, animals, history, or travel.) * What interests me a lot right now? (For example, a new idea, a new hobby, or politics.) *  What do I tell other people about? (For example, a favorite story, movie, or school event.)\\n## Decide who will tell your story.\\nStories are told from different points of view. A point of view is the voice used to tell the story. It is influenced by the viewpoint character's age, knowledge, experience, and feelings. The choices below affect how much the reader knows about the characters and actions in the story. * **First person**: The narrator is a character in the story and tells the story using the word I. The reader knows only what the narrator knows, thinks, and feels.   * **Second person**: The narrator tells a story to another character using the pronoun you. The reader hears the story as if it is happening to him or her.    * **Third person**: The narrator tells the story using third-person pronouns like he and she.

{"prompt": "How do I write a novel What should I know?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Writing a novel involves detailed planning, creative storytelling, and dedicated writing and revising. Here are some key concepts to help you along the way. You can jump to any section by clicking the links below.\\tPlanning\\t\\tBefore you write a single word, it's important to have a plan. Planning your novel helps organize your ideas, ensures coherence in your story, and establishes key concepts such as theme and conflict.     \\tUnderstand the basics of a story\\t\\tMost stories share similar elements that make them engaging for readers. Familiarize yourself with key concepts such as characters, setting, and theme. The most common story elements include:           Characters: The individuals who the readers follow throughout the story. Most novels focus on a main character, called the protagonist, who has a goal and faces challenges to achieve it.     Setting: The time and location of the story. It can take place in the past, present, or future, and may even take place in a fictional world like in fantasy novels.     Plot: The sequence of events that occur in a story, including key moments that advance the story, create tension, or lead to resolution. Most plots are structured around a conflict, which the main character must resolve to reach their goal.     Theme: The underlying message, central idea, or moral of the story. Some themes are universal and relatable to many readers.    Style: A novel's tone and voice that gives it a specific emotional impact. It includes the author's and characters' unique way of speaking or writing.        \\tNovels come in many forms and styles. Often, they fall within different genres, each with its own conventions and expectations. For instance, fiction genres include romance, science fiction, and murder mysteries. Nonfiction genres include cookbooks, memoirs, and essay collections. If you're unsure what genre to write in, review the different genres and their key elements to determine what style best suits your ideas.    \\tDecide which idea is worth pursuing\\t\\tAfter brainstorming potential ideas for your novel, it's time to choose which one you'll dedicate time to writing and revising. Think about what excites you most and what you're passionate about sharing with readers. Ask yourself questions like:           What topics do I feel most strongly about?     What parts of my life do I want to share with others?     What impacts do I want my readers to feel?     What excites me the most?        \\tChoosing an idea that seems \\\"safe\\\" or will please others often leads to a lack of inspiration. Instead, ensure you choose a topic that resonates with you personally.\\tWriting\\tAfter you've planned your novel, it's time to start drafting and writing! You may find it helpful to follow a specific process, such as prewriting, drafting, revising, and publishing. However, every writer's process is unique.      \\tPrewriting\\t\\tPrewriting is planning and preparing for your novel and may include brainstorming, researching, outlining, and storyboarding. You may also brainstorm scenes, dialogue, or character descriptions. Although one person may complete prewriting in a few days, another may spend years gathering materials before drafting. A few tips to consider include:           Keep a notebook. Carry a notebook with you at all times so you can jot down ideas, observations, or memories related to your novel.     Join a writing group. Engage with other writers. Share ideas, give and receive constructive feedback, and organize writing exercises like collaborative storytelling.     Freewrite. Set a timer and write freely for a set period of time. Don't stop writing or edit your work during this timeframe. Just get your ideas out on the page.        \\tSpecify your audience\\t\\tCreating your novel for a specific audience can help strengthen your writing as it adds focus and makes the writing more engaging. For example, a young adult novel will not appeal to the same audience as a historical romance novel. Consider questions such as the following:           Who are my characters? Do they reflect the audience I want to engage?     What age group will my readers be?     How will my story sound when I tell it out loud?     How much will my readers want to learn?        \\tOutline your novel\\t\\tAn outline helps you organize your thoughts and maintain momentum while writing your novel. It serves as a roadmap, helping identify important elements of your story, and can guide your decisions about story pacing. You can include as many details as you want in your outline, including:           A synopsis of the novel     Key scenes or milestones     Character sketches     Themes or messages     Location sketches         Consider breaking your outline into acts, chapters, or scenes to help organize it. For example, you may create an outline using the three-act structure, which is broken up into these parts:           Beginning (Act 1): The main character and the situation or story conflict are introduced. For example, an ordinary person discovers a mysterious object that gives them superpowers....

Here\u2019s an overview of how photosynthesis works, along with tips for understanding the process:\\n\\n### Overview of Photosynthesis\\n\\n1. **Key Ingredients**: Photosynthesis requires three main ingredients:\\n   - **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: Taken from the air through tiny openings (stomata) in the leaves.\\n   - **Water (H2O)**: Absorbed from the soil by the roots and transported to the leaves through the stem.\\n   - **Light Energy**: Captured from sunlight using chlorophyll, the green pigment found in chloroplasts of plant cells.\\n\\n2. **Chemical Reaction**: The overall chemical reaction for photosynthesis can be summarized as:\\n   \\\\[\\n   6 \\\\text{CO}_2 + 6 \\\\text{H}_2\\\\text{O} + \\\\text{light energy} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{C}_6\\\\text{H}_{12}\\\\text{O}_6 + 6 \\\\text{O}_2\\n   \\\\]\\n   This means six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water, using light energy, are converted into one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen.\\n\\n3. **Two Stages of Photosynthesis**:\\n   - **Light-Dependent Reactions**: These occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and captures its energy. This energy is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The energy from this reaction is stored in ATP and NADPH (energy carrier molecules).\\n   - **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)**: These occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts. ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide from the air into glucose.\\n\\n### Tips for Understanding Photosynthesis\\n\\n- **Visualize the Process**: Diagrams and flowcharts can help illustrate where in the cell different parts of photosynthesis occur (like chloroplasts and thylakoid membranes) and how the inputs are converted into outputs.\\n- **Remember the Importance of Chlorophyll**: Emphasize the role of chlorophyll in capturing light energy, which is vital for the entire process.\\n- **Link with Cellular Respiration**: Understand that photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary processes. The oxygen and glucose produced in photosynthesis are used in cellular respiration, which in turn produces carbon dioxide and water used in photosynthesis.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nPhotosynthesis is a fundamental process for life on Earth, forming the base of the food chain and contributing to the oxygen content of the atmosphere.

It occurs mainly in the leaves of plants, where chlorophyll (the green pigment) captures sunlight. Most photosynthesis occurs in leaves. Here is a brief overview of the process:  1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of plant cells absorbs sunlight, providing the energy needed for photosynthesis. 2. **Water Splitting (Photolysis)**: The plant roots absorb water from the soil, and the sunlight energy splits the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide to create glucose (sugar), while the oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct. 3. **Carbon Dioxide Fixation**: Plants also take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small openings in the leaves called stomata. The carbon dioxide combines with the hydrogen (from the split water molecules) to make glucose. 4. **Sugar Creation**: In a series of chemical reactions (Calvin Cycle), the hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to form glucose, a simple sugar. 5. **Storage and Use**: The glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth, and excess glucose is often stored as starch for later use.    **Tip for remembering the process**: A simple formula to remember how photosynthesis works is:  **Sunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide \u2192 Glucose + Oxygen**   It's often depicted in a chemical equation:  **6 CO2 + 6 H2O  \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 O2**.    **Other tips**: - Remember that photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). - Light reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and produce ATP and NADPH; Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of chloroplasts and uses ATP and NADPH to create sugar.\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose (a type of sugar).

Chloroplasts are organelles that house chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures light energy, usually from the sun. \\n\\nHere are the main steps involved in photosynthesis:\\n1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light energy, mostly from the blue and red wavelengths of light.\\n2. **Water Splitting**: Light energy is used to split water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O).

In plants, photosynthesis occurs in leaves which contain chlorophyll pigments in chloroplast organelles. Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red wavelengths of sunlight and reflects green light, which is why plants look green. The energy from sunlight is converted into ATP and NADPH during the light-dependent reactions. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is an energy-carrying molecule that carries energy within cells. NADPH is an electron carrier that stores energy in its high-energy electrons.

The glucose created by photosynthesis can be converted into starch and stored in plant structures such as roots, tubers, seeds and fruits.                    \\n    \\n        Importance of Photosynthesis\\n                    Photosynthesis is vital to all living things on Earth because it is the primary source of organic matter for almost all organisms. It is also responsible for providing the oxygen in our atmosphere.   Plants provide energy, food and shelter for other living things. Plants, through photosynthesis, produce glucose. Herbivores (plant eaters) eat plants for food and in turn, carnivores (meat eaters) eat herbivores for energy. Even decomposers, like bacteria and fungi, rely on plants to produce their food. These relationships among organisms are food chains and food webs.   Since plants form the base of many food webs, photosynthesis supports the energy and oxygen that fuel life. Any change in the rate of photosynthesis will affect all organisms.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Light-dependent and light-independent reactions enable photosynthesis.                    There are two main stages of photosynthesis:                    1. Light-dependent reactions occur in and adjacent to thylakoids of chloroplasts. 2. Light-independent reactions occur in the stroma of chloroplasts.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Photosynthesis Phases\\n                    Light-dependent reactions are the first phase of photosynthesis. This reaction occurs when light strikes a leaf's chlorophyll molecules and excites electrons. Through the following steps, energy from the electrons is captured.    Step  1:  Capture of light energy             Thylakoid membranes, which are lipid structures with proteins (that include pigment molecules), photophosphorylate ATP during the light reactions of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll pigment molecules capture sunlight and energize electrons. As excited electrons move through the thylakoid, they travel down an electron transport chain, which energizes electron carrier molecules such as ATP and NADPH.     Step  2: Water is split    There is an equilibrium of water and oxygen in thylakoids. When sunlight strikes chlorophyll, energized electrons cause water molecules to split into oxygen gas, hydrogen ions and electrons. Oxygen gas is released into the air; electrons enter electron transport chain; and hydrogen ions are actively transported into the thylakoid.    Step  3: ATP and NADPH to stroma \\t  The hydrogen ions pass (diffuse) from the thylakoid into the stroma through a channel protein called ATP synthase. This causes ATP synthase to rotate like a turbine and ATP is formed and sent into the stroma. H ions join with electrons and NADP to form NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH will proceed into the next phase of photosynthesis, the Calvin Cycle.

When chlorophyll absorbs light energy, it becomes \\\"excited\\\" and releases energy and high-energy electrons. These are captured by electron carriers, which transport them to power various processes:\\n   - **Water Splitting**: Water molecules are split to release oxygen, protons, and electrons. The oxygen is released as a byproduct.\\n   - **ATP Production**: The energy from excited electrons helps to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is used as an energy currency in cells.\\n   - **NADPH Formation**: Electrons are transferred to the electron carrier molecule NADP+ to form NADPH.\\n\\n2. **Light-Independent Reactions** (Calvin Cycle): These reactions occur in the stroma of chloroplasts and do not directly require light, but depend on the ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent reactions. The major steps include:\\n   - **Carbon Fixation**: Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is attached to a 5-carbon sugar (ribulose biphosphate) by the enzyme RuBisCO. This produces a 6-carbon intermediate that quickly splits into two 3-carbon molecules.\\n   - **Reduction Phase**: The 3-carbon molecules are converted into a carbohydrate (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) using the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions.\\n   - **Regeneration Phase**: Some of the produced carbohydrate is used to regenerate ribulose biphosphate, allowing the cycle to continue. Some of the carbohydrate can be used to form glucose and other carbohydrates.\\n\\n### Importance of Photosynthesis\\n\\n- **Oxygen Production**: Photosynthesis is responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, which is vital for the survival of aerobic organisms including humans.\\n- **Foundation of Food Chains**: Nearly all life on Earth depends on photosynthesis.

These reactions take place in chloroplasts, specialized organelles found in plant leaves. Light is captured during the light reactions and is used to make ATP and NADPH, which are energy carriers. During the Calvin cycle, carbon atoms from carbon dioxide are fixed into glucose using ATP and NADPH made during the light reactions.         Light reactions of photosynthesis.    1.

Water is also split in this process, providing electrons to replace the excited electrons, releasing oxygen gas as a by-product of photosynthesis.     2. The excited electrons from the first chlorophyll complex entered an electron transport chain. Their energy is used to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoids. The hydrogen ions flow back out through ATP synthase, making ATP.     3. The excited electrons from the second chlorophyll complex are transferred to NADP+, forming NADPH.     4.

These reactions take place in and along the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.              Calvin cycle of photosynthesis.    1. The Calvin cycle uses carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as a source of carbon for making glucose. Carbon dioxide enters through the stomata and combines with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO. The resulting 6-carbon compound immediately splits in half.     2. The two 3-carbon molecules, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), are converted into 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This requires ATP and NADPH made during the light reactions.        3. During one cycle, one G3P is made for every three carbon dioxide molecules that enter the cycle.  The Calvin cycle must turn three times to make one G3P. G3P can then be converted into glucose and other organic compounds.    4. The remaining G3P molecules regenerate ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), the molecule that initiates the Calvin cycle.

Stage one: Light-dependent reactions**\\nDuring the first stage of photosynthesis\u2014light-dependent reactions\u2014energy from sunlight is captured and stored in the molecules of ATP and NADPH. This process occurs in the thylakoid membranes. The overall equation of the light-dependent reactions is:\\n            light + water -> ATP + NADPH + oxygen The first steps of photosynthesis involve pigments such as chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, collecting photons (light energy) from the Sun. This light energy excites electrons in the chlorophyll, which then pass through a series of proteins embedded in the thylakoid membrane, known as the electron transport chain. As the electrons move through the chain, they lose energy. This energy is used to pump protons (hydrogen ions) from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen, creating a concentration gradient. Protons then flow back into the stroma through ATP synthase, a protein that uses the energy of this gradient to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. In non-cyclic photophosphorylation, the electrons are replenished by splitting water (photolysis), producing oxygen. When light hits Photosystem I, the high energy electrons get picked up by NADP+ reducing it to NADPH. The ATP and NADPH produced in this stage are used in the second stage of photosynthesis.\\n\\n**3.

The overall simplification of photosynthesis can be represented by the chemical equation:\\n\\\\[\\n6CO_2 + 6H_2O + light \\\\ energy \\\\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\\n\\\\]\\nThis equation means that carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), in the presence of light energy, are transformed into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2).\\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Here are a few techniques that can enhance your learning or retention of information. The active learning strategies below do not include basic study techniques such as rereading notes or textbooks or listening to lectures without any feedback or interaction. Basic study techniques should be minimized whenever possible.\\n\\nActive learning techniques\\nThe following techniques involve actively engaging with the material you're studying. \\n- **Practice retrieval:** This technique is extremely effective for learning new information. To make sure you remember what you've studied over time, take time to practice bringing information to mind without looking it up. This could include taking practice quizzes on the material, writing a summary of what you've learned, or creating flashcards of key information. If you're studying for an exam, be sure to use practice tests or questions that are similar to those you'll have on the exam. \\n- **Distribute practice over time:** Practicing information at different points in time - rather than all at once - makes learning more effective. This is sometimes called spaced practice. Try to build your study schedule so you're regularly revisiting the information over time instead of cramming for tests.\\n- **Formulate actions plans:**  To keep yourself on track while studying, create an actions plan. Write down specific actions you intend to take in order to meet your study goals. Review this plan regularly, and update it as needed.\\n- **Elaborative interrogation:** When applicable, ask yourself why the information is true and try to come up with explanations for why. Connect what you're trying to learn with things you already know about a topic.  \\n- **Interleave practice:** It may help to mix up (or interleave) different types of problems or materials in one study session. For example, if you're studying problems in math and history, practice some problems from math, then do some history, then do some more math, and so forth.\\n- **Self-explanation:** Whenever you learn something new, explain the material out loud in your own words (or write it down) the way you would to another person. \\n\\nOther study techniques\\nThe following study techniques have not been found to be effective. You may want to limit your time spent using them. \\n- Summarizing information that you've read, known as \\\"oral summarization\\\" or \\\"written summarization\\\"\\n- Highlighting or underlining, or using an identifying marker to highlight important information.\\n- **Re-reading texts**\\n- **Listening to lectures without any additional engagement** (ie, taking notes, asking questions, etc.)\\n\\nBuild a study plan\\nSuccessful students use a study plan that includes the following:\\n- Learning goals. **Write down specific goals for what you want to learn in this class. Find out what the exams will cover and how they will be graded.** If you can, identify the study skills that will help you meet your goals. Use these skills in your study sessions. Adjust your study goals as needed. \\n- A focal study point.  **Choose a specific topic for each study session.** Then start the study session by asking yourself several questions such as \\\"What do I know about this topic?\\\" \\\"Where can I find this information if I forget anything?\\\" \\\"What parts of it are most important or most difficult for me to understand?\\\" If you work with other students or a tutor, agree on a focal study point before the session so you can all be ready to discuss the topic.\\n- Study rewards. **Create a system of rewards to help you keep up with your study plan.** This might include planned breaks or informal quizzes of what you've been studying, which you can reward yourself for getting correct.  \\n\\nBe an active learner\\nStudents who get involved in their own learning understand and remember the material better. To be an active learner, try to do the following:  \\n- **Think about what you're studying.** Spend a little time each week thinking and writing about what you study. How does it relate to your other courses, to your life, to what skills you might need for jobs or internships?  \\n- **Ask questions** (of your teachers, peers, and your own self). Trying to answer these questions can help deepen your understanding and keep your interest alive.   \\n- Value your classes and what you learn in them. It can be easy to see topics you\u2019re not interested in as \u201cboring,\u201d but if you try to find something visually interesting in them - or something you can connect to your own life - you'll learn more.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

This method strengthens your memory and understanding.\\n\\n2. **Spaced Repetition**:\\n   - **Explanation**: Spaced repetition is a technique where you review the material over increasing intervals of time. \\n   - **How to Use It**: Use spaced repetition software (like Anki) to schedule reviews expertly. Alternatively, plan reviews on your calendar: study today, then review the same material in one day, then two days, one week, etc. This takes advantage of the psychological spacing effect.\\n\\n3. **The Feynman Technique**:\\n   - **Explanation**: This technique is based on the idea that if you can't explain a concept simply, you don't understand it well enough. \\n   - **How to Use It**: Choose a concept and explain it as if you are teaching it to someone else. If you get stuck, go back to your study material to understand those parts better, and then revise your explanation.\\n\\n4. **Mind Mapping**:\\n   - **Explanation**: Mind mapping is a visual study technique that helps organize information in a way that makes sense to you. \\n   - **How to Use It**: Start with a central idea in the middle of the page. Draw branches for related ideas and add details to those branches. Use colors, images, and symbols to make it more engaging.\\n\\n5. **Interleaving Practice**:\\n   - **Explanation**: Interleaving practice is the technique of mixing different topics or types of problems in one study session. \\n   - **How to Use It**: Instead of studying one type of math problem all at once, practice a variety of problems in the same session. This helps you learn to apply the right technique and strengthens your problem-solving skills.\\n\\n6. **SQ3R**:\\n   - **Explanation**: SQ3R is a reading comprehension method that stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. \\n   - **How to Use It**: Survey the material to get an overview, then pose questions about what you want to learn. Read to find answers, recite the information from memory, and finally review the material to reinforce it.\\n\\n7. **Chunking**:\\n   - **Explanation**: Chunking is the process of breaking down complex information into smaller, more manageable units or \\\"chunks\\\". \\n   - **How to Use It**: Instead of memorizing a long number as 123456789, break it down into chunks like 123-456-789. This can be useful for studying vocabulary, formulas, and even lecture notes.\\n\\n8. **Retrieval Practice**:\\n   - **Explanation**: Similar to active recall, retrieval practice refers to the act of bringing information to mind to enhance learning and memory. \\n   - **How to Use It**: After studying, write down everything you remember about the topic without looking at your notes, and then check your notes to see how much you got right. This reinforces what you've learned.\\n\\nImplementing these study techniques actively in your study sessions can help you understand and remember information more effectively.

There are apps like Anki or Quizlet that can help schedule these reviews for you.\\n\\n3. **Pomodoro Technique**:\\n   - **What it is**: A time management method to improve productivity.\\n   - **How to Use**: Work for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro), then take a 5-minute break. After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This keeps your mind fresh and focused.\\n\\n4. **Interleaved Practice**:\\n   - **What it is**: Mixing different topics or types of problems in a single study session.\\n   - **How to Use**: Instead of studying one type of math problem, study different types in one session. This enhances problem-solving skills and deepens understanding of subjects.\\n\\n5. **Self-Explanation**:\\n   - **What it is**: Explaining how you solved a problem or why you made a decision.\\n   - **How to Use**: While studying, pause to explain the material to yourself in your own words. This can be done out loud or in writing and helps identify gaps in your knowledge.\\n\\n6. **Elaborative Interrogation**:\\n   - **What it is**: Asking \\\"why\\\" to the material you are studying.\\n   - **How to Use**: For example, when learning a fact, ask yourself why that fact is true and how it relates to what you already know. This ties new information with existing knowledge.\\n\\n7. **Mind Mapping**:\\n   - **What it is**: A visual organization tool that uses diagrams to represent words, ideas, tasks, or other concepts linked around a central concept.\\n   - **How to Use**: Start with a central concept and branch out with related ideas, using colors and images to enhance memory.

Study for 50 minutes, then break for 10 minutes.\\n- Stop to stretch or take a short walk during breaks.\\n- During your breaks, move around to help boost your energy.\\n\\n**Review Strategies**\\nOne effective way to learn new information is to write it down. After reading your assignment or lesson materials, summarize what you've learned in writing. Use the summaries or other notes with these techniques to help you remember what you've learned.\\n- **Cornell notes**. Write a page of notes, such as during a lecture. Later, return and write a 2- or 3-sentence summary of the page. Next, return one more time to create \\\"keywords\\\" or triggering questions in the left column. These keywords and your summary can help you quickly review the notes.\\n- **Human mapping**. This technique comes in handy and can be useful if you enjoy learning on the move. Create a large version of a \\\"mind map\\\" or visual organizer by drawing the map on the ground. Use chalk or tape to mark the center idea, parts that support the center idea, and smaller details that belong with each part. Walk along the lines as you explain how the ideas connect.\\n- **Mapping** or a **cluster diagram**. Use boxes, circles, or words in colorful markers to show the relationships among different ideas. Draw a big, box with the main idea in the center. Leave space around the box for other details. These details can connect to the main idea with lines, curves, or arrows. Each new level of a cluster should keep getting smaller, too.\\n- **Mnemonics**. Create an expression, such as a rhyme, acronym, or sentence, to remember a list of items.\\n- **Visualizing** or **imagery**. After reading a passage of text, close your eyes and picture the information in your mind. Try to create a picture that represents what you read. This could be a drawing of ideas or key items, or a more interesting image meant to trigger your memory.\\n- **Keyword method**. For foreign-language vocabulary, say the word in a similar-sounding word in English. Create a two-part image that connects the foreign language word with the familiar meaning.\\n\\n**Test Taking Strategies for Multiple Choice Questions**\\n- Answer the questions you are sure about first. Then, go back and answer the other questions.\\n- Use your best judgment on a question if you do not know the answer. A good guess is better than leaving the question unanswered.\\n- Read the question and all of the answers carefully.\\n- Look for key words, such as \\\"always\\\" and \\\"never.\\\" They can help to distinguish between similar answer choices.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

{"prompt": "What are some effective study techniques What should I know?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"What should you know about study techniques? Study techniques are strategies that can help you learn material more effectively. Some study techniques can improve your ability to take in and process information. Others can improve your ability to remember and use information. The best techniques for you depend on your learning style, preferences, and study needs.\\n                    Effective study techniques include the following:\\n                \\n                \\n                    Read thoroughly and actively.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Being an active reader can help improve your learning. Your brain takes in and retains information better when you are an active reader. To become an active reader, try these tips:\\n                          - Take notes in the margins. Write comments about what you are learning in paperbacks or magazines.  For e-readers, type notes in a separate document or use the note or highlight feature.\\n                          - Ask questions. While you read, pause to think about what you already know about the topic. Ask yourself questions about what you just read. For example, What ideas are new to me? This part reminds me of... Why does this make sense? - Share your thoughts. Talk about what you're reading with friends or classmates. You can help each other understand the material better.\\n               \\n                \\n                 \\n                \\n                \\n                    Make sure you understand the material.\\n                \\n                \\n                    To check your understanding, try saying things aloud in your own words. This technique is helpful for learning complex or difficult ideas. For example, you might say, \\\"I understand that 'X' means....\\\" Saying it in your own words can show whether you really understand it.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Practice new skills.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The best way to learn new skills is to practice them. Set aside time to practice skills, such as math and writing. Try to practice these skills every day or several times a week.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                    Use mnemonic devices.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Mnemonic devices are tricks that can help your brain remember things. For example:\\n                          - Acronyms are words made up of the first letters in a list of words that you need to remember. For example, the planet names can be remembered in the sentence, \\\"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles. This makes the first letters of the first seven words an acronym-Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. - Rhyme and songs. Making a rhyme or song is a fun way to help your brain remember things. For example, to remember how to order operations in math, you can use \\\"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\\\" This helps you remember that to solve math problems you use Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction in that order.\\n               \\n                \\n                 \\n                \\n                \\n                    Practice retrieval and retrieval practice.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Forgetting is a normal part of learning because our memory has limits. To learn what information is important and to remember it later, check yourself regularly. The process of forgetting and relearning can help fix the learned material more firmly in your brain. For example, use these types of practice:        -  Flashcards: Write down one question on the front of a card and the answer on the back. Go through the cards and say aloud the answers before you turn over the card to see if you got the right answers. You can write the definitions of words or other types of information on flashcards to help remember them. Use them often!     -  Study groups: Being part of a study group can help some people practice retrieval better. As a group, ask and answer questions until you understand the material. Try to put the material in your own words. If you study with a group, make sure everyone knows and follows the agreed set of rules. Groups work best when everyone can share the responsibility. Here are some other helpful hints:              \\n                            Initial meetings: Meet with your group during the first week of class to get to know each other and to work out the structure of the group.  Set clear goals: Decide what you want to get done during each group meeting.  Prepare: Come to the meeting ready to discuss what you have learned so far.  Follow rules: At the start of each meeting, decide which rules the group wants to follow. Put someone in charge of leading the group and keeping the meeting on track.        -  Quizzes: Taking quizzes can also help students practice retrieval.\\n                \\n                \\n                 \\n                \\n                \\n                    Space out your learning.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Spaced practice or distributed practice is repeated studying over a long period of time. For example, a student might review notes each week rather than just before a test.   This is a contrast to cramming or massed practice, which is trying to learn all the material in a short amount of time. Studies show that students who study the same amount of information by staying with spaced practice tend to remember more than students who cram before a test.   Re-testing is one way to make spaced practice work better. Crammers may know the material in the short term, but they remember less of it\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"   \\t   \\t  Study techniques improve learning by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of learning.

Creating a summary helps students practice talking about the lesson they learned. It is generally more effective for students to prepare a summary with the help of a teacher or classmates. For example, they might prepare a summary as a broken down version of the lesson. Students can use different colors or sizes to make different parts stand out.

If you are studying at home, find a quiet place (for example, your bedroom or a study) to get away from distractions. Keep it clean and organized. Make sure you have all necessary supplies. If you can, avoid studying in bed, where you may fall asleep. If you plan to study for a long time, take regular breaks, stretch, eat a healthy snack, and drink water. -  Setting a study schedule. A regular study schedule may help you organize your time and are less likely to be rushed before a test. Use a planner to organize your time. Schedule each of your activities, including sleep, school, travel, study time, and free time. -  Taking good class notes during the lecture. This may help you know what material is the most important. Be an active listener. Ask questions to clarify confusing points. Try to aim your notes at your future self. Write down the words that you think will jog your memory when you review your notes. -  Studying detailed class notes after the lecture. Set aside a specific time every day to study your class notes. Try to do this at the same time every day to build a routine. -  Joining or forming a study group. A study group can help you learn by making studying more fun and more interesting. Have all group members agree on the time and place of each meeting. When you meet, try to stay on task and avoid distractions, such as cell phones. -  Reviewing the chapter before the lecture.

You may find it helpful to use different techniques in different subjects. For example, you may prefer making outlines for history, but prefer cluster diagrams for math.\\n\\nFlashcards\\nFlashcards are useful tools when you need to memorize information. You can make flashcards with index cards or small pieces of paper. For each fact you want to memorize, write a question on one side of the card and the answer on the other. Here are some tips for using flashcards effectively:\\n- Only write one question or fact on each card. \\n- Make sure your printing is clear. \\n- Organize your flashcards into three groups. Set aside a group for flashcards that you know well, one for those that you are unsure of, and one for those that you do not know at all. Review the cards in each group often, especially the ones you do not know. \\n- Use your flashcards in different ways. For example, try saying the answer out loud before you flip the card over. \\n\\nGraphic Organizers\\nGraphic organizers can help you learn information more effectively and can make studying more interesting.\\n-  Cluster Diagrams:  A cluster diagram lets you show the connections between ideas. Write an important idea or word in a circle in the center of the page. Write other ideas around the center circle in other circles. Connect those circles to the center with lines. You can keep adding circles and lines to organize more ideas. \\n-  Webs:  A web is similar to a cluster diagram, but it can look different.  Draw circles with ideas inside them and connect them with lines that show how ideas are related. You can make arrangements that look like waves, spider webs, or anything else you think of.\\n-  Outline:  An outline lets you put ideas in a numbered or lettered list to show their order or importance. Put the main idea at the top of the page. Write numbers or letters to mark facts and details below it. \\n\\nOutlines\\nAn outline lets you list and organize ideas in a way that shows their order or importance. Outlines also help you study the key facts and details you need to know. To make an outline, follow these tips:\\n- Use numbers or letters to list the main idea, key facts, and supporting details. For example, your outline might look like this:         1. Main idea            A. Key fact or detail                 1. Supporting detail            B. Key fact or detail                  2. Supporting detail.        - You might use decimal numbers in a longer outline. For example, it might look something like this:         1. Main idea            1.1 Key fact                  1.1.1 Supporting detail                  1.1.2 Supporting detail                 1.2 Key fact                  1.2.1 Supporting detail            2. Main idea                  - Use indentation to show which facts support which ideas. For example, it might look like this:         1. Main idea            A. Key fact                 1. Supporting detail                 2. Supporting detail            B. Key fact                 1. Supporting detail\\n\\nSummaries and Paraphrasing\\nSummarizing and paraphrasing are good ways to be sure you understand what you read.\\n-  Summarizing:  To summarize, write an overview of the main points of what you have read or learned. Keep it short.\\n-  Paraphrasing:  To paraphrase, write what you have read or heard in your own words. Do not copy the exact words. Paraphrasing helps you remember what you learn.\\n\\nAdditional Study Techniques\\n- Look for Main Ideas: Most subjects have main ideas, or most important ideas, in each section. Looking for main ideas while you read helps you remember what you learn. Main ideas are often at the beginning of a paragraph or at the end. Information in lists or outlines can also help you find main ideas. - Previewing: Previewing helps you get an idea of what you will read. Before you read a chapter in a textbook, look at the title, headings, and any pictures. Start to think of questions you have about the chapter. As you read, you will want to answer these questions. - Teaching: Explaining something you learned to someone else, or even to yourself, can help you remember it. This works especially well if the person you are explaining it to asks questions. \\n\\nWhat Should I Know?\\n\\n-  Use effective study techniques: Study techniques can help students memorize information.\\n-  Organize your materials: Organizing materials can make studying easier.\\n-  Set a time to study: Setting a time to study can help students remember to study.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

{"prompt": "What are some famous philosophical quotes Can you explain?", "completions": ["{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":0,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Here are some famous philosophical quotes along with explanations of their meanings:\\n\\n1. **\\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\" - Ren\u00e9 Descartes**\\n   - Explanation: This statement, originally \\\"Cogito, ergo sum\\\" in Latin, is a fundamental element of Western philosophy and epistemology. Descartes used it as a first principle to build his philosophy on doubt and certainty. If he is thinking, he must exist; his doubting and questioning prove his own existence.\\n\\n2. **\\\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\\" - Socrates (as reported by Plato)**\\n   - Explanation: Socrates believed that self-reflection and critical analysis of one's life, values, and beliefs is essential to human existence. Living without examining your life's purpose and place in the world is a wasted opportunity to be truly human and fulfill your potential.\\n\\n3. **\\\"To be is to be perceived.\\\" - George Berkeley**\\n   - Explanation: This principle of immaterialism posits that objects do not exist independently of the minds that perceive them. Therefore, for something to 'be,' it must be perceived by a conscious entity. In essence, existence itself is tied to perception.\\n\\n4. **\\\"Hell is other people.\\\" - Jean-Paul Sartre**\\n   - Explanation: This quote comes from Sartre's play \\\"No Exit.\\\" It conveys the idea that individuals can be trapped and defined by others' perceptions and judgments, leading to emotional or existential anguish. The torment of the characters comes not from their physical surroundings but from their interactions and the way they view each other.\\n\\n5. **\\\"Man is the measure of all things.\\\" - Protagoras**\\n   - Explanation: This statement suggests that human beings are the standards or criteria for understanding all things, implying that what is true or exists varies based on individual perception. This idea reflects a form of relativism: truth and reality are subjective and contingent on personal experiences.\\n\\n6. **\\\"Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\\\" - Ludwig Wittgenstein**\\n   - Explanation: Wittgenstein believed that many philosophical problems arise from misunderstandings and confusions created by language. By clarifying language and our concepts, we could dissolve these philosophical problems rather than try to solve them. Philosophy's purpose, then, is to combat these confusions.\\n\\n7. **\\\"Life must be lived as play.\\\" - Plato**\\n   - Explanation: Plato suggests that approaching life with a sense of playfulness and creativity is essential. This could mean embracing spontaneity, being flexible, and engaging in imaginative pursuits. Such an approach may make life more meaningful and fulfilling.\\n\\nThese quotes demonstrate the complexity of philosophical inquiry and reflect various philosophical schools and thinkers throughout history.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Sure! Here are several philosophical quotes, along with explanations of their meanings and the ideas they express.\\n\\n1. **\\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\" - Ren\u00e9 Descartes**\\n   - **Explanation**: This statement (in Latin, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum\\\") is a fundamental element of Western philosophy and epistemology. Descartes used this phrase as a first principle in his writings to demonstrate that the act of thinking is proof of one\u2019s existence and consciousness. If one is doubting or questioning, this itself indicates that there is a \\\"self\\\" to do the doubting, and thus the existence of that self is undeniable.\\n\\n2. **\\\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\\" - Socrates**\\n   - **Explanation**: This assertion implies that self-reflection and critical thinking about one's life, actions, and purpose are essential to truly living a meaningful life. To merely exist and not engage in introspection, moral questioning, and search for deeper understanding renders life less valuable.\\n\\n3. **\\\"To be is to be perceived.\\\" - George Berkeley**\\n   - **Explanation**: This principle, known as \\\"idealism,\\\" suggests that the existence of an object relies on it being observed. According to Berkeley, physical objects have no reality outside of our perception of them; therefore, if something is not being perceived, it does not exist in any meaningful way.\\n\\n4. **\\\"He who thinks great thoughts, often makes great errors.\\\" - Martin Heidegger**\\n   - **Explanation**: This idea suggests that ambition and deep thinking can lead to mistakes or misjudgments. People who think about lofty ideals or envision grand possibilities may overlook practical details and make errors in judgment or action as a result. This serves as a caution about the dual nature of ambition and creativity.\\n\\n5. **\\\"Man is condemned to be free.\\\" - Jean-Paul Sartre**\\n   - **Explanation**: Sartre's existentialism posits that humans have absolute freedom to make choices and face the consequences of those choices. This freedom is both a gift and a burden; it can feel like a condemnation because, without a predetermined essence or purpose, individuals must create their own values and meaning in their lives. In essence, we are both the creators and the products of our choices.\\n\\n6. **\\\"An unarmed man can only flee from evil, and evil is not stopped by an unarmed man.\\\" - Jeff Cooper**\\n   - **Explanation**: This quote suggests that passivity and inaction do nothing to thwart wrongdoing or evil. The need for self-defense and a proactive stance against malevolence is emphasized; individuals (or society) must be prepared to take action or confront challenges instead of merely avoiding or fleeing them.\\n\\n7. **\\\"That which does not kill us makes us stronger.\\\" - Friedrich Nietzsche**\\n   - **Explanation**: Experiencing and overcoming hardship or trauma builds resilience and can enhance character. Difficult situations can strengthen our ability to cope with future challenges. However, Nietzsche's idea is not to glamorize suffering but to suggest that confronting affliction and pain can be part of a journey toward personal development.\\n\\nThese quotes encapsulate complex ideas within a few words and have inspired philosophical thought, ethical discussions, and personal reflection for centuries.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Certainly! Here are a few notable quotes from philosophers, along with explanations of their meanings:\\n\\n1. **\\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\" - Ren\u00e9 Descartes**\\n   - **Explanation**: This foundational statement of Western philosophy suggests that the very act of thinking is proof of one's existence. Descartes used this phrase to demonstrate that the mind and consciousness are undeniable realities, even if we cannot be certain about the physical world.\\n\\n2. **\\\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\\" - Socrates**\\n   - **Explanation**: According to Socrates, a life without reflection, questioning, and seeking wisdom is a life that is not truly fulfilling or meaningful. It emphasizes the importance of self-examination and the pursuit of virtue.\\n\\n3. **\\\"Man is condemned to be free.\\\" - Jean-Paul Sartre**\\n   - **Explanation**: In Sartre's existentialist philosophy, human beings are given the freedom to make choices, but this freedom can be burdensome because it comes with the weight of responsibility for those choices. To be \\\"condemned\\\" to be free is to be placed in a position where one must constantly make choices, even when one would prefer not to.\\n\\n4. **\\\"Happiness is the highest good.\\\" - Aristotle**\\n   - **Explanation**: Aristotle believed that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve eudaimonia, often translated as happiness or flourishing. This happiness is not a fleeting feeling but a long-term state achieved through virtuous living and fulfilling one's potential.\\n\\n5. **\\\"The only thing I know is that I know nothing.\\\" - Socrates**\\n   - **Explanation**: This statement reflects Socratic wisdom\u2014the awareness of one's own ignorance. By acknowledging that he knows nothing, Socrates demonstrates humility and opens himself to learning and philosophical inquiry.\\n\\n6. **\\\"I can control my destiny if I believe in my self.\\\" - Anonymous**\\n   - **Explanation**: This quote emphasizes the importance of self-belief and agency in shaping one's own life. It suggests that one's attitude and faith in oneself can significantly influence the course of one's life.\\n\\n7. **\\\"To be is to be perceived.\\\" - George Berkeley**\\n   - **Explanation**: This phrase encapsulates Berkeley's idealism, the philosophy that physical objects do not exist independently of the perceptions we have of them. For Berkeley, to exist is to be perceived by a mind, and since God perceives everything, things continue to exist even when not perceived by humans.\\n\\nThese quotes capture profound ideas that have influenced philosophical thought and human understanding throughout history.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Sure! Here are some famous philosophical quotes along with explanations of their meanings:\\n\\n1. **\\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\" - Ren\u00e9 Descartes**\\n   - **Explanation**: This statement is a fundamental element of Western philosophy and expresses the idea that the very act of thinking is proof of one's existence and consciousness. Descartes used this as a starting point to build a foundation for knowledge.\\n\\n2. **\\\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\\" - Socrates**\\n   - **Explanation**: Socrates suggests that self-reflection and seeking knowledge about oneself and the world are essential for a meaningful life. To live without questioning one's beliefs, values, and purpose is therefore to miss the essence of life itself.\\n\\n3. **\\\"To be is to be perceived.\\\" - George Berkeley**\\n   - **Explanation**: Berkeley's philosophy, known as idealism, suggests that physical objects do not exist independently of the perceptions we have of them. Thus, \\\"to be\\\" means \\\"to be perceived.\\\" This asserts the primacy of the mind and ideas over the material world.\\n\\n4. **\\\"Man is the measure of all things.\\\" - Protagoras**\\n   - **Explanation**: This quote expresses a form of relativism, suggesting that individuals determine the truth and meaning of their experiences. Different people will perceive and measure things differently based on their own perspectives.\\n\\n5. **\\\"Hell is other people.\\\" - Jean-Paul Sartre**\\n   - **Explanation**: From Sartre's play \\\"No Exit,\\\" this phrase encapsulates the idea that other people can be a source of torment, particularly when their opinions and judgments force us to confront uncomfortable truths about ourselves. It reflects existentialism's themes of individuality and external judgment.\\n\\n6. **\\\"One cannot step twice in the same river.\\\" - Heraclitus**\\n   - **Explanation**: This quote emphasizes the idea of constant change, suggesting that everything is in a state of flux and nothing remains the same. Even the river is not the same from one moment to the next, nor are we when we step into the river again.\\n\\n7. **\\\"The only thing I know is that I know nothing.\\\" - Socrates**\\n   - **Explanation**: This statement reflects Socratic wisdom, where he acknowledges his own ignorance. It suggests that recognizing one's lack of knowledge is the first step toward gaining true knowledge.\\n\\n8. **\\\"Life must be lived as play.\\\" - Plato**\\n   - **Explanation**: Plato believed that life should not be taken too seriously, and that playfulness, creativity, and spontaneity are essential to the human experience. \\\"Play\\\" implies freedom, joy, and artistic expression.\\n\\nThese quotes and their explanations provide a glimpse into the depth and variety of philosophical thought across history.

Below are several famous philosophical quotes, along with explanations for each one.\\n\\n1. **\\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\" - Ren\u00e9 Descartes**\\n   - **Explanation:** This statement, originally in Latin (\\\"Cogito, ergo sum\\\"), is a fundamental element of Western philosophy and serves as a declaration of self-awareness and existence. Descartes devised this phrase to establish a certain foundation for knowledge, arguing that the very act of thinking implies a thinking subject exists.\\n\\n2. **\\\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\\" - Socrates**\\n   - **Explanation:** This quote, attributed to Socrates by Plato, suggests that a life devoid of introspection, reflection, and questioning lacks meaning or value. Socratic philosophy emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and ethical living, making the examination of one's life essential.\\n\\n3. **\\\"Human beings can be happy only if they do not assume that their happiness depends on anything external.\\\" - Epictetus**\\n   - **Explanation:** This quote reflects the Stoic philosophical viewpoint that happiness arises from within, independent of external circumstances or material possessions. True contentment stems from one\u2019s own choices, perceptions, and attitudes, rather than what happens externally.\\n\\n4. **\\\"To be is to be perceived.\\\" - George Berkeley**\\n   - **Explanation:** This principle of idealism posits that the existence of an object is contingent upon it being perceived by a conscious being. Berkeley argues that material things exist only to the extent they are perceived and that God perceives all things, ensuring their existence.\\n\\n5. **\\\"Man is condemned to be free.\\\" - Jean-Paul Sartre**\\n   - **Explanation:** In Sartre's existentialism, this quote encapsulates the idea that humans are thrust into a world devoid of intrinsic meaning and must choose their path.

He urged acceptance of rules that govern human relationships, including the admonishment that all people should \\\"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.\\\" Society must be based on love; that duty constitutes the foundation of all relationships: familial, friendly, and political.   Confucius placed great importance on education for individuals as well as society at large. He extolled the virtue of individual self-control and the duty of individuals to act as caregivers for the young, the old, and those sick or without allies.   Confucius's thought had enormous influence on Chinese culture.

He also founded a school of philosophy in ancient Greece.   Plato believed that the ultimate objective of knowledge, philosophy, religion, and human activity in general is to encourage individuals to become virtuous. Platonic virtue consists of four specific ideals: wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. In Plato's ideal society, virtue would be expressed in three special classes: workers producing goods; warriors protecting society; and rulers governing society. In Plato's concept of a virtuous individual, reason (wisdom) controls the spirit (courage) and appetites (moderation) to produce the best outcome (justice).   His view of virtue was partly an outgrowth of his belief that physical objects on Earth are mere shadows of forms of those objects that exist only in the senses; philosophers, Plato argued, see those forms more clearly than others.   Historical records about Plato's life are sparse, but there is some knowledge about his work. His writings focus on ethics, politics, and virtue.\\n\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t            \\tRoman philosopher Cicero championed liberty in an age of tyranny.\\n\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\\"The safety of the people shall be the highest law.\\\"                             Cicero lived and wrote during an unstable time in Roman history. His greatest concern was to defend liberty (as expressed in this quote).  Cicero emphasized the need for a government to lead citizens toward the common good, as distinct from tyranny, through law. He placed some reinterpretation on the earlier Greek thought of natural law: While the Greeks accepted the concept of natural law, Cicero believed that law reposes within human nature and through rational thought. This philosophical position would later be termed naturalism.   His writings had enormous influence on Renaissance thinkers about politics. He extolled defense of liberty as an active endeavor that can lead individuals toward discovering their better selves.\\n\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t            \\tChinese philosopher Laozi advocated for human beings to embrace the natural world.\\n\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\\"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom; mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.\\\"                             Laozi, the reputed author of the Dao De Jing, founded the school of thought developed by Daoism, or Taoism.

Everyone is a philosopher. We think philosophically when we seek the truth about ourselves, the world, and our relationships to the world and to each other. Each of us approaches philosophical questions from our own standpointspersonal, cultural, religious, and others. Our answers are shaped by our experiences, our education,, and our ideas about what is important or of value. Philosophical questions develop in the context of our lives, and our answers shape how we will live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some questions are both philosophical and scientific. Humans have always asked questions about who we are and our place in the world but science investigates the physical and natural world in a way that is different from philosophy. Questions are often both philosophical and scientific when, for example, the answers depend on how we choose to understand or interpret certain facts. Science tests its conclusions by gathering data, looking for patterns, and making predictions based on those patterns. Philosophy searches for understanding by asking questions like the following:     * What does it mean to say something is \\\"real\\\"?    * Is there a God? How can we know?    * Why are we moral? How do we choose to act?    * What does it mean to know something?    * What is the nature of good and evil?    * What is beauty? Why do we make and respond to art?    * What is the meaning of life?                                                                                                                                                                                                            ------------\\n                                   \\n                                                             \\\"I think, therefore I am.\\\"                                                                                \\n                                                            - Descartes, Meditations on First Philosophy                                                                                          \\n                                                            \\n                                                            \\n                                                              Philosophical quote strategies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\n                                                            \\n                                                                                                                                      \\n                                                            \\n                                                             - To help students approach philosophical literature and writing.\\n                                                            \\n                                                            \\n                                                             - To help students connect philosophical literature to life.\\n                                                            \\n                                                             \\n                                                             \\n                                                                    \\\"A wise man does not lay up his own treasures.

Consider trying the following strategies to help you cultivate good habits.\\n     - Start small: While it can be tempting to take on multiple new projects at once, your schedule will likely become overwhelming. Consider starting with two or three small changes until they become routine, rather than taking on a larger challenge that may be draining. For example, if you want to read every day, aim for just five pages every day instead of the full-length book.\\n     - Remain consistent: When starting new habits, consistency can be key. Try repeating the new activity at the same time and in the same context every day in order to reinforce the behavior. For example, you could do sit-ups after brushing your teeth every morning or write a daily journal entry before bed each night. Consistency can also help to identify a habit as one that you can do easily or feel good about.\\n     -  Rely on existing routines: Incorporate new habits into your daily routines to help reinforce and continue them. For instance, if you walk your dog every evening, consider walking to a new park nearby that you've wanted to explore. Over time, you will create new routines around your dog walks while also taking advantage of the ones you currently have.\\n     - Avoid distractions: Sometimes, elements of your environment can hinder you from developing good habits. Identify any distractions that can make an activity less enjoyable.

Prepare lunch foods with vegetables in advance. Slice and store extra portions of vegetables after dinner. Make a whole grain salad or a soup. When you make dinner, make extra to pack for tomorrow's lunch! 2. Look for fast lunch foods. Eat ready-to-cook vegetables and salad mixes in a vacuum-packed bag, salad already made, or frozen vegetables that have just been heated. Make sack lunches with fresh fruit for dessert or a snack.   3. Cooked lunches can be made in advance with cakes, al-dente pasta, rice and grain salads, eggs, muffins or single servings of soup. Even food made after work can be ready in half an hour.   4. Pack lunch while you're packing dinner.  Packing lunch in the middle of prepping dinner makes it less likely something will be skipped.    5. Bring it: Water to drink and to boil when cooking pasta, rice and quinoa.

The important thing is to start communing and exploring your thoughts and feelings through the written word.\\n\\n## Benefits of Journaling\\n\\nSome benefits of journaling include:\\n\\n- **Reducing stress and aiding problem-solving**: Journaling about stressful experiences can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings, enabling you to move ahead with your life. In one study, writing about stress but then also writing about ways to control it helped students reduce their feelings of helplessness.\\n- **Enhancing your mood and sense of well-being**: Journaling can enhance your mood and improve your sense of well-being. Writing in a journal can help you understand your emotions and make sense of difficult experiences in your life, which may improve your emotional health. Journaling can also help you engage with positive experiences, memories, and feelings, boost your mood, and enhance your sense of well-being.\\n- **Improving your immune system**: Journaling about emotions can improve your immune system function, perhaps because it reduces stress. For example, in a small study, writing about emotions helped participants have fewer immune system problems over time compared to those who did not journal. Similarly, another small study found that participants who wrote about their feelings had improved immune function compared to a control group.\\n- **Helping you achieve goals, resolve problems, and make decisions**: Journaling can help you develop a clearer idea of what you want in life and how you can achieve it. For example, in a small study, increasing high school students' amount of journaling about their goals improved their academic performance and attendance at school. Likewise, students who wrote more about how they felt about stressful experiences become better at concluding their problems.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Journaling can be a powerful tool for personal growth, emotional regulation, and creative expression.

This radiation is mostly xray and ultraviolet, but also consists of visible light and infrared rays. Sun rays travel through to reach Earth, some become trapped under the atmosphere, warming the planet.       Ocean currents.        Oceans shape climate by their currents, such as the Gulf of Mexico and warm currents along the equator.     And vacillation of the jet stream, the sun and motion of clouds above the ocean surface, may affect climate worldwide.       Earth's position.        Tilt and wobble of the planet will cause changes in the amount and location of sunlight that filters to Earth, rotating from day to night.   This can affect climate cycles of 10 million years or so.     Earth experiences climate every 100,000 years, with the widest ice sheets melting, leaving a very, very slow melt.        Volcanic eruptions.        Fossil fuel combustion releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide;  inflating the number and size of the greenhouse gases, thereby altering vegetation as oceans heat Up.   Particles erupting into the atmosphere scatter outside and incoming sunlight and cause cooling.       Internal variability.        For example, fine particles from the sun, known as hurricanes, are released in a catchy tone through a wide el ni\u00f1o.

This is called global warming.\\n         Climate change.    Although global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably, the two terms have different meanings. Global warming refers specifically to an increase in Earths average surface temperature, while climate change refers to the broader range of changes that go along with an increase in temperature. Climate change includes rising sea levels, shrinking mountain glaciers, and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. In addition to rising temperatures, climate change can lead to more extreme weather events including heavy rain, intense droughts, and dangerous storms.\\n    \\n    \\n         Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.\\n         \\n                Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas emitted by human activities.    The burning of fossil fuels (such as coal and oil) for energy is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-related fossil fuel CO2 emissions increased from 20 billion metric tons in 1980 to 34 billion metric tons in 2019. Since 1970, emissions from coal have more than doubled (increased by 119%), and emissions from oil and natural gas have increased by 21% and 45%, respectively. These large increases in energy-related CO2 emissions are caused by both an increase in the amount of energy used by the worlds population and an increase in the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy used.     Changes in the land surface, including deforestation, grassland conversion, and agricultural practices, also result in carbon dioxide emissions. For example, cutting and burning forests releases the carbon stored in trees and burning grasslands releases carbon stored in soils.     The oceans absorb some atmospheric carbon dioxide. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it increases the oceans acidity. Since the beginning of the 19th century, ocean acidity has increased by 30% and is expected to continue to increase with higher atmospheric CO2 levels. This threatens marine life that relies on forming shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate, including corals and shellfish.        Methane emissions, especially from agriculture, have increased.    Methane has more than 25 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period, though it only remains in the atmosphere for about a decade. The largest sources of human-caused methane emissions are agriculture, landfills, and natural gas systems. Agricultural methane emissions are mostly a result of enteric fermentation (digestive process) of ruminants (such as cows). Landfill methane emissions occur when organic waste doesn't have enough oxygen to decompose completely. Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas. Methane emissions are also released during the use of natural gas and biomass.     Methane emissions from wetlands have also increased, especially in the tropics.         The warming effect of nitrous oxide is almost 300 times that of carbon dioxide, but it only remains in the atmosphere for several hundred years, depending on its removal rate.    The largest sources of human-caused nitrous oxide emissions are agricultural practices, fossil fuel combustion, and industrial processes. Agricultural sources include nitrogen-based fertilizer application on soils, cultivation of organic soils, and livestock manure management.   Atmospheric nitrogen pollution in coastal marine environments in the form of fertilizer runoff has resulted in increased growth of algae and other organisms (eutrophication). When they die, bacteria that break them down consume oxygen in the water, which can create a \\\"dead zone\\\" that kills marine life trying to access the low oxygen waters.\\n    \",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Climate change is caused by factors that include both natural processes and human activities.

Every transaction in this public ledger is recorded with an encrypted digital signature. Because they are all cross-checked in real time by millions of computers and every transaction is recorded in a public ledger, it is impossible to cheat the system. This makes it nearly impossible to hack the blockchain, whereas regular data stored on a single server -- even a server with dozens of mirror storage -- can be hacked.\\nBlockchain has numerous business applications, including enabling secure online payment transactions and tracking items in a supply chain.\\nBelow is a simple explanation of how blockchain technology works:\\nStoring data in blocks\\nData is stored in blocks of information. Each block has three components:\\n-    A block number\\n-    Data inside the block\\n-    A block header, which includes the time that the block became active, a 64-character string known as a hash, and the hash of the previous block in the chain\\nBlocks in a blockchain are like pages in a ledger. Just as a new page in a ledger does not erase the information on a previous page, when a new block of data is created in a blockchain, the information on the previous block remains. This makes it easy to look back at a previous page in the ledger to check on data.\\nCreating a chain of blocks\\nIn a blockchain, each piece of data is connected to the ones before and after it, which creates a long chain of data blocks. Once an entire chain is created, it becomes part of a ledger.\\nEach block is connected to the block before it through the hashing process, which makes it nearly impossible to change the information in a block. Also, because blocks in a blockchain are created all across the world and then connected to each other, they cannot be deleted by a single person.\\nEvery data transaction has its own unique hash so that it stays connected in the series of transactions. Hashes are used to protect the data that is inside the block and to connect blocks in a blockchain. When someone makes an update, a new hash is created, which then changes the hash of any block that came after it in the chain. This makes it easy to tell if someone has tried to change the data inside a block because it would change the hash, and the updated hash would no longer match the next block.\\n    \\nTips on planning an event\\n- Be specific about your intentions for the event and work your plan around what you hope to achieve. A humanitarian event should be planned and designed by people who share the values of the event and its audience.\\n- Create a realistic budget that includes all of your expenses and sources of revenue.\\n- Avoid making your event bigger than it has to be by focusing on making your event deeper rather than wider. Some matters are best exemplified through a handful of focused deeply explored stories.\\n- Let your imagined audience inform every detail of how you host your event.\\n\\nExamples of leading things\\n- Steps: Leading things help to define the boundaries of a design. When spacing them out in relation to each other, think about how they relate to the overall design rather than just to each other.\\n- Overlapping shapes: Overlake your design shapes in a dynamic way to create new patterns within the design.\\n    - Use shape and color change as a tool to strengthen your design.\\n    - Draw several iterations of the design to explore new ways to think of space plant elements.\\n        Use extraneous motions, lines and shapes.\\n        Think positively, where things go (or might go).\\n        Center focus events within boundaried spaces that align with the outside time to create calm within chaos.\\n        \\n\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively.

Every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger. Blockchain is used to store cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain can be used in various industries aside from cryptocurrency including healthcare, finance, supply chain and more.\\n\\n### Benefits of Using Blockchain\\n\\n- **Trust**: Transactions are stored on a block and a chain that is immutable (cannot be changed). This helps ensure data recorded is true and verifiable.\\n- **Decentralization**: Helps eliminate the need for third parties to verify transactions, which speeds up the transaction processing time.\\n- **Security**: Cryptography helps ensures that transactions are secured and users can control their own private keys.\\n- **Immutable records**: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without the consensus of the network.\\n\\n### Types of Blockchains\\n\\n- **Public blockchain**: Any user on the internet can access and use a public blockchain (permissionless). This type of blockchain is typically decentralized and used for cryptocurrencies. For example, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.\\n  \\n- **Private blockchain**: This type of blockchain is closed (permissions) and users can be invited to join.

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or steal information. Blockchains are usually managed by a peer-to-peer network of computers (often referred to as nodes) that abide by a protocol for communicating with one another. When a block of data is added to the chain, it is appended to the end of an existing chain with a cryptographic signature, timestamp, and a record of previous blocks in the chain. Each block in the chain is made up of three pieces of information:          *   Transaction data. This is the information that is recorded in the block. In the case of a Bitcoin block, this is the details of each transaction, such as the time and date of the transaction and the amounts of Bitcoin involved in each transaction.    *   Participant data. This is the information about the participants in the transaction, such as their unique cryptographic public key (a long string of numbers and letters) that serves as their digital signature.     *   Nonces. This is a number that is generated randomly when a block is created. When the block is completed, the nonce and the hash of the previous block are combined to create the first block in the chain.\\n    \\nBlockchains are unique because they store and share data in a peer-to-peer network, which eliminates the need for a central authority to manage or secure the data. When computers get together to share their ledgers through the blockchain network, the computers create a unique identity on behalf of an organization, which is then used to send and receive data. These identities do not act solely on the instructions of the organization, however. Instead, they communicate with each other using the same data management tools that have been given each computer in the network.\\n    \\nOnce a block of data is added to a blockchain, it is nearly impossible to change. Changing any one block would require redoing all the blocks after it because each block contains the information of the block before it. Additionally, because copies of the blockchain are stored on computers throughout the network, a rogue actor would need to change all of the copies at the same time in order to change a block. This makes blockchains very secure against tampering.\\n    \\n### Why use blockchain?\\nBlockchain is beneficial in that it serves as a secure, immutable ledger that is easy to verify and audit.    *  Secure. Its distributed ledger technology makes it difficult for a hacker to corrupt the database. Hackers would have to corrupt every single copy of the ledger stored on computers across the network in order to change a single record.    *  Immutable. Information once written cannot be changed because blocks are chained together. Additionally, information in blocks is secured through cryptographic hash functions.    *  Easy to verify and audit.

For Bitcoin, the block records the date, time, and dollar amount of the transaction. It also records the participants using a unique string of numbers to identify them.\\n  \\n2. **Block Creation**: Once the block has been filled with data, it is added to the chain in chronological order.

A ledger is a record of transactions or data. So a digital ledger is a record that is stored electronically. There are three important things to understand about the digital ledger that is used in blockchain technology:\\n   - The digital ledger is not stored in one location, so it is public and easily accessible.\\n   - The digital ledger is not controlled by a central authority, so no one person or group can govern the ledger.\\n   - The digital ledger is secured using encryption, so it is safe from hacking.\\n\\n4. **Verification**: Once a block is filled with data and added to the chain, it cannot be changed. Changing the information in a block would mean changing all of the blocks after it as well as getting the agreement of all the people on the network. This makes blockchain technology very secure against hacking.\\n\\n### Advantages of Blockchain\\n- **Transparency**: Changes to public blockchain are publicly viewable by all parties and are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or deleted.\\n- **Security**: Data is stored across a network of computers rather than on one central server for additional security.\\n- **Reduced Costs**: Eliminating third-party intermediaries can save money.\\n- **Traceability**: Easy tracking of assets and supply chains.\\n\\n### Use Cases\\n- **Cryptocurrencies**: Most commonly associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\\n- **Supply Chain**: Improves the flow of information throughout and between an entire supply chain.\\n- **Healthcare**: Provides accurate records of who accessed sensitive data in the healthcare industry.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBlockchain technology is changing how we do business across industries, from banking to food safety, and its full potential is yet to be known.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Sure! Blockchain is a new technology that allows digital information to be distributed, but not copied. This technology was invented in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta to stamp documents with a date and time so that the data could not be backdated or tampered with. This technology was first made popular with the creation of bitcoin, a digital currency, in 2009 by an unknown person or persons using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\\nBlockchain is a shared database that stores information in groups called blocks. As each block fills with data, it is added to a chain of blocks, creating a blockchain. Each block has a timestamp and links the previous block, creating a chain of blocks - or a blockchain. Once information is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered. This is because all blocks contain a unique code called a hash (like a fingerprint) that is created using password-protected software. If someone tries to change the information in one of the blocks, the unique code, or hash, also changes.\\nOnce a block is filled with information, it is placed on a public record of all the blockchains, called a ledger. A ledger is securely stored across a network of many computers in different locations. These computers remove duplicate records and only keep the most up-to-date information on the ledger. When a server on the network records a new block on the ledger, it is time-stamped and made visible to everyone who is part of the process or transaction. All copies of the ledger are updated at the same time. Only the most current version of the ledger can be edited, and any old versions are kept as a record.\\nIn order to create a new block, a majority of the computers on the network must first agree that the transaction is legitimate. This is called consensus. Once a block is created, it is very hard to change it without the agreement of all of the computers in the network. This makes blockchain secure against fraud and tampering.\\nBecause of the security and trust created by this digital ledger that keeps track of the currency exchanges, multiple parties can exchange information without needing to rely on a single central authority (such as a bank or escrow service). Blockchain can be used for many different purposes including financial transactions, sharing of medical records, and payments processing. Sometimes, it is called decentralized technology because it does not rely on a central server or single authority to manage or store information.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

This method can be used in several types of health information exchange activities. Blockchain could facilitate:         - Accessing clinical patient data.    -  Creating a linkage between health data collected over time.    -  Increasing transparency about research data.         Blockchain technology might also support the usability of these activities.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Accessing Clinical Patient Data\\n                    Blockchain technology can safely store and securely share low volume and high value clinical patient data, such as psychiatric medications, genetic test results, or a summary of a previous head injury. Health care providers, patients, and application developers could each own a copy of the blockchain or access it through the internet. Ownership of the clinical data would stay with the clinical provider. Users would have different permissions to access and share different types of data on the blockchain.        -  Patients would have their own private key, a secure password or a digital identification, which       grants them access to their data on the blockchain. These patients could grant specific       permissions to give health care providers or family or friends access to share those specific data      with them. Patients could use their digital private key to negotiate the sale of their data for       research, data analytics, or training artificial intelligence.    - Health care providers would have different cryptographic keys, a different password, than the       patients. With access to the implicit permission granted through their digital key, providers could       seamlessly share their consented data for real time research or savings rate calculations.         These permissioning controls protect patient privacy and security while easing health information exchange. The solution can also ensure that patient privacy is maintained throughout the transactions. This approach can also create a search tool that matches patients with potentially lifesaving clinical trials.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Creating a Linkage Between Health Data Collected Over Time\\n                    When a patient data record is created, a health care provider or another trusted source would enter the data into the blockchain using their specific private key.

Every transaction in this digital ledger is recorded as a block of data. When a transaction is completed, it is added to a block of data that consists of up to one megabyte of information. Once the block is filled, it is added to the chain of existing blocks in chronological order. Because the chain of blocks is stored on a decentralized network of computers (also called nodes), it is nearly impossible to alter the information in the blocks without the consensus of the network. A blockchain has three main components:          -  Transactions. Each transaction includes information about the transaction, such as the date, time, and dollar amount. Each transaction also includes information that identifies the parties involved in the transaction.     - Blocks. Each block contains a set of transactions and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, its own hash, and a timestamp. Cryptographic hashing protects the information in the block, making it very difficult to alter the information without detection.    - Chain. Each block links to the previous block, which forms the chain of blocks.\\n                \\n                \\n                    How does blockchain work?\\n                    Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. This technology works by having its data put into a public database. The data is then duplicated and distributed across a network of computer systems across the globe (like nodes), and these computers validate the transaction through the use of a consensus mechanism. Once validated, the transaction is combined with others to create a new block of data for the ledger. Each block in the chain has a specific number of transactions it can fill before its added to the chain of existing blocks in the database. Each block also contains a unique code called a hash which acts like a fingerprint, distinguishing it from every other block. Once a block is filled, it is added to the chain in chronological order. All these features make blockchain highly secure and trustworthy, since the data is virtually impossible to alter or hack.\\n                \\n                \\n                    How do I begin?\\n                    Blockchains can have a variety of different purposes, from supporting smart contracts to supply chain tracking.

An asset can be tangible (like a house, cash, or land) or intangible (like intellectual property, patents, or copyrights). Almost anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.    A blockchain is a collection of records, or blocks, that are linked to one another, in chronological order, in a digital chain (hence \\\"blockchain\\\"). Each block in a blockchain contains a number of transactions. Every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participants ledger. This means that everyone on the network has access to the entire database and its immutable record of transactions.     Blockchains are secure by design and are an exemplary use case for immutable data.  Data entered is irreversible; it cannot be deleted. Records can only be appended to the end of the database. This cannot be modified by any user with access to the database. It also means that historical data cannot be altered without the consensus of all participants in the system. \u3000 \u3000     Rather than storing information within a central location businesses store their information in a decentralized manner. There are many benefits to a decentralized network including:     - Resilience. Information cannot be lost or destroyed under a natural disaster or system failure.     - No single point of access. Reduces the likelihood and volume of security breaches across the entire platform.    - Multiple user access. Information can be accessed anywhere and at any time by verified users leading to increased transparency and efficiency.          Blockchain uses a consensus mechanism to agree on the validity of transactions. For instance, in everything from transactions to contracts to records to events, parties previously had to reconcile their different versions of the truth. With blockchain, there is only one version of the truth, which is shared and agreed upon by all parties. Once entered, no one can change that truth without the consensus of the group. Blockchain is a solution for the current need for trust among transacting parties and is best for environments where trust is lacking.      By offering a way for untrusting parties to cooperate at a lower cost with greater security, blockchain can reduce the need for third parties such as banks or notaries.\\n                   \\n            \\n                \\n                    What are the benefits of blockchain?\\n                \\n                \\n                    Reducing costs and increasing efficiency\\n                    Blockchain technology has the potential to replace high-cost and slow manual processes with lower-cost and faster alternatives. By providing a single version of the truth to multiple parties, blockchain can eliminate data reconciliation and reduce the need to clear and settle transactions, which can take time and incur costs. The technology helps to minimize redundancy, cuts out intermediaries and reduces delays. For example:          In the securities industry, transactions can take from two days to a week to settle. Blockchain settlements can occur in real time, or near real time, and are expected to reduce the need for working capital and potentially reduce overall trading costs by 20-30%2 In 2019, Nasdaq explored the use of blockchain to advance settlements.          In agriculture, blockchain can allow producers to share product data with suppliers, distributors and retailers giving everyone access to a single source of the truth. Farmers can save time and money by becoming more efficient in auditing and billing.           \\n        \\n                \\n                    Improving security and reducing fraud\\n                    Blockchain technology creates an immutable record of transactions that is accessible to all authorized users. It also uses encryption to protect record-keeping and requires validation of information entered onto a blockchain. All these features help to reduce fraud. Blockchain also better secures sensitive transactions against hacking and give users more assurance that transactions are authentic.     For example:        Blockchain technology has prevented banking fraud on the Kiva community lending platform and increased transparency.         In Egypt, blockchains help ensure authenticity and reduce fraud around certificates for training programs from Microsoft, Cisco and others.    In Armenia, blockchain technology assisted in securing property registers to avoid corruption and fraud.       \\n        \\n                \\n                    Creating new business models and revenue streams\\n                    Blockchain technology is opening the door for new business models and revenue streams for businesses. New businesses, even in existing markets, are likely to emerge around blockchain offerings.     For example:        In South Africa, a company developed a blockchain application to reduce the cost of remittance transfers in half by creating a pan-African quick transfer system of digital currencies backed by local currencies.         In the airline industry, one company is using blockchain to allow customers to book flights in smaller increments, such as one-minute flights, and only pay for what they use       \\n        \\n                \\n                    Providing easier access to financing\\n                    By one estimate, nearly six trillion dollars in unfulfilled demand for loans exists3 around the world, especially among small and medium-size businesses and individuals.

These include:          -  Ethereum, whose \\\"ether\\\" tokens are used to pay for transactions on the network. Smart contracts - automated transactions like digital vending machines - can be programmed using the Ethereum blockchain.    -  Litecoin, which promises to process a block every 2.5 minutes, compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.

Each node has a copy of the entire blockchain, ensuring that it is not stored in a single location.\\n\\n2. **Transparency**: Transactions on a blockchain are visible to all participants in the network. While the identity of the participants might be hidden and represented by pseudonyms or public keys, the transaction data is open for everyone to see, which can enhance trust and accountability.\\n\\n3. **Immutability**: Once data has been recorded on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. If someone tries to change the information in a block, they would also have to change the hash of that block in every subsequent block, making such a modification easily detectable.\\n\\n4. **Consensus Mechanisms**: Blockchain uses various consensus mechanisms to agree on the validity of transactions. Different blockchains use different methods, such as proof of work (used by Bitcoin) and proof of stake (used by Ethereum 2.0), to achieve consensus among nodes and ensure that all copies of the distributed ledger are the same.\\n\\n5. **Cryptography**: Blockchain makes use of cryptographic techniques to secure data, control the creation of new blocks, and verify the transfer of assets. Public and private keys are used in transaction processes, ensuring security and anonymity.\\n\\n### How Blockchain Works\\n\\n1. **Transaction**: A transaction is initiated, such as the transfer of cryptocurrency from one person to another.\\n\\n2. **Block Creation**: The transaction is packaged together with other pending transactions into a block by a node (sometimes referred to as a \\\"miner\\\").\\n\\n3. **Distribution**: The newly created block is sent out to all nodes in the network for verification.\\n\\n4. **Verification**: The nodes examine the transactions in the block to ensure they are valid according to the rules of the blockchain.\\n\\n5. **Consensus**: Once a sufficient number of nodes confirm the transaction is valid, the block is added to the existing chain of blocks.\\n\\n6. **Completion**: The transaction is complete and can be viewed (but not altered) by all participants in the network.\\n\\n### Applications Beyond Cryptocurrencies\\n\\nWhile blockchain is best known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies, its benefits and reliability make it useful in various fields, such as:\\n\\n- **Supply Chain**: Tracking the provenance of goods and ensuring transparency in the supply chain.\\n- **Healthcare**: Maintaining patient records that are secure, immutable, and accessible only to authorized personnel.\\n- **Voting**: Ensuring that votes are recorded securely and accurately, preventing manipulation or fraud.\\n- **Finance**: Enabling faster, more secure transactions and the creation of new financial products.\\n- **Identity Verification**: Providing a way for individuals to manage and verify their identity digitally.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBlockchain represents a new method of storing and sharing information securely and transparently.

This is the ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drives, as well as their effect on others.

Emotional intelligence (also known as EQ or emotional quotient) matters just as much as cognitive intelligence when it comes to your success in life, work, relationships, and even your physical well-being.\\n\\nThe cornerstone of emotional intelligence is being aware of your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. From there, you can begin to manage your feelings and respond to the feelings of others with empathy and compassion without becoming overwhelmed. The ability to organize your feelings and thoughts, prioritize tasks, motivate yourself, and make decisions can also improve with emotional intelligence.\\n\\n\\nEmotional intelligence can be learned and improved. To increase your emotional intelligence, practice the four key skills it involves:\\n\\n1. **Emotional awareness** -- the ability to recognize your own emotions and their effects. Emotionally aware people can articulate their feelings and can recognize the emotions of others and understand the effect those emotions have on other people. \\n2. **Self-regulation** -- the ability to manage your emotions in healthy ways. People who practice self-regulation think before they act and can read the emotional cues of others. They are able to express their feelings appropriately and can calm down when they are upset, as a means to manage the moment, prevent problems and relieve stress. \\n3.  **Social skills** -- the ability to manage relationships and build networks. People with strong social skills are expert communicators, leaders, and can work well with a team. They are able to develop and maintain good relationships, can resolve conflicts, and are often very persuasive. \\n4.  **Self-motivation** -- the ability to motivate yourself to take action. People who practice self-motivation are often optimistic in the face of failure, believe they can influence events, and pursue goals even when they are faced with obstacles or setbacks.\\n\\nThese four skills of emotional intelligence help people to control their impulses, manage their moods, enhance their motivation, empathize with others, and use their emotions to communicate well and resolve conflicts.\\n\\nResearchers have found that the components of emotional intelligence can be grouped into five basic categories.

Meditation practices may include breathing practice, body scan, noticing sounds, or guided meditation.      -  Yoga. Mindful yoga combines physical postures, breathing exercises, meditation, and the recognition of mental and emotional aspects of practice. Regular yoga practice has beneficial effects on physical and mental health.      -  Mindful walking. Mindful walking can also be done while standing, sitting, and lying down. Mindful walking involves awareness of the experience of standing and walking, paying attention to the experience of the body moving through space and of gravity pulling down on the body.      -  Mindful eating. Mindful eating involves giving full attention to the experience of eating and drinking, both inside and outside the body. It involves observing colors, smells, flavors, textures, tempers, and even sounds of our food. It also involves noticing the experience of the body and the thoughts and emotions that arise during eating.      -  Mindful movement. Mindful movement is a general term that encompasses tai chi, mindful walking, and yoga. It involves the connection between body and mind where participants are fully present and aware during movement.      -  Body scan. A body scan is a meditation practice in which attention is systematically focused on the body in a gradual sequence from head to feet or feet to head. The purpose is to notice any sensations, emotions, or thoughts about different parts of the body.     Informal practices:      -  Mindful train commute. Mindful commute involves paying attention to mood, thoughts, sensations, and the experience of commuting.      -  Mindful transitions.

In recent years, it has gained popularity as a weight-loss and general health strategy. The goal of the keto diet is to put your body into a state of ketosis, where it relies on fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.\\n\\n### Key Features of the Keto Diet:\\n- **Low Carbohydrates:** Typically, the diet involves consuming only about 5-10% of your total daily calories from carbohydrates.\\n- **High Fat:** About 70-80% of your calories come from fats.\\n- **Moderate Protein:** About 10-30% of your calories come from protein.\\n\\n### How it Works\\nWhen you eat a diet high in carbohydrates, your body breaks down the carbs into glucose (sugar), which it then uses for energy. However, when you reduce your carb intake, your body runs out of glucose and starts to break down fat for energy instead. This process produces ketones, which your body can use as an alternative energy source.\\n\\n### Potential Health Benefits\\n- **Weight Loss:** Many people lose weight quickly on the keto diet, particularly in the first few weeks.\\n- **Increased Energy:** Some followers of the diet report increased energy and focus.\\n- **Therapeutic Effects:** Originally used for epilepsy treatment, some research suggests potential benefits in other conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\n### Concerns and Considerations\\n- The keto diet can have side effects, including \\\"keto flu,\\\" digestive issues, and nutrient deficiencies, especially in fiber and certain vitamins.\\n- Long-term effects of the diet are not well studied.\\n- It may be difficult to stick with the strict dietary limits, leading to yo-yo dieting.\\n\\n### Foods to Eat and Avoid\\n- **Foods to Eat:** Meat, fatty fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, seeds, healthy oils, avocados, low-carb vegetables.\\n- **Foods to Avoid:** Sugary foods, grains, starchy vegetables, beans, fruits, and some condiments and additives.\\n\\nBefore starting any new diet, especially one as restrictive as the keto diet, it's a good idea to talk with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan designed to change the way your body metabolizes nutrients.

Stock markets can refer to collectively all of the stocks trades in one geographical location or on one market exchange, and can also indicate a group of stocks, such as the technology stocks or the entire stock market of the whole world.\\n\\n## What is a stock?\\nWhen you buy a companys stock, you purchase a little piece of that company. Owners of common stock may receive dividends, which are payments made by the corporation to its stockholders. Usually, common stockholders receive dividends only after all other expenses and preferred stock dividends have been paid. As an owner of common stock, you get to vote on important matters, such as electing the board of directors. The value of common stock may go up or down depending on how well the company does. \\n\\nThe company that sells the stock gets money to invest in growing the company.\\n\\n## Why do people buy stocks?\\nMany people buy stocks so they can earn a return on their investment. The money made from investing, is called a return. The return on stock investments comes in two ways:\\n1. **Dividends**: A dividend is a payment to stockholders, usually as a portion of a companys earnings. The amount of the dividend depends on how much money the company made and how much it wants to pay out as dividends. The company may decide to keep some of its earnings to reinvest in the business, increase the firms financial strength, or pay off debt. \\n2. **Selling stock for a higher price than paid**: Investors try to buy stocks at a low price and sell them at a higher price. An example of when a stock price may go up is when the company sells more products or services and makes a larger profit. On the other hand, stock prices can go down too, as when a company makes less profit, or does not sell its products or services as expected.\\n\\n## Who are the buyers and sellers?\\nIn most states, a securities dealer, also called a stockbroker, is someone who is licensed to buy and sell stocks for other people. A stockbroker is paid a commission (fee) for the work of bringing together buyers and sellers. When the buyer of a stock places an order with a stockbroker, the broker finds a seller and arranges the deal. The price of the stock is the same for buyers and sellers only if the transaction takes place on a stock exchange. If the buyer is willing to pay a higher price or the seller wants a lower price, the transaction takes place in an over-the-counter market where stockbrokers negotiate and set the stock price. \\n\\n### Problems with buying and selling stocks\\nHeavy demands for buying and selling can sometimes affect transactions in the stock market. When there is a heavy demand to sell stocks, sellers interests come first. Buyers are willing to pay only a certain amount of money for a stock. If there are few buyers at that price, sellers have to lower the price. On the other hand, sellers interests come first when there is a heavy demand to buy stocks. Buyers want to pay the lowest price they can. If there are few stocks at that price, buyers have to raise the price. This is called the \\\"law of supply and demand.\\\" When there are many stocks for sale, prices often drop. When there are few stocks for sale, prices usually go up.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The stock market is a collection of markets and exchanges where activities such as buying, selling, and issuing shares of publicly-held companies occur.

The primary market is where stocks are created, while the secondary market is where existing owners can sell their stocks to other investors.\\n\\n### 2. **Types of Markets**\\nThere are two main types of stock markets: organized exchanges and over-the-counter markets.\\n- **Exchanges**: These are central locations (physical or virtual) where stocks are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.\\n- **Over-the-Counter (OTC)**: This is a decentralized market where trading occurs directly between two parties without a central exchange or broker. It involves networks of dealers who negotiate directly for prices.\\n\\n### 3. **Market Participants**\\nParticipants in the stock market include:\\n- **Retail Investors**: Individual investors who buy and sell stocks for their personal account.\\n- **Institutional Investors**: Organizations that invest on behalf of their members, such as pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies.\\n- **Stockbrokers**: Individuals or firms that are licensed to buy and sell stocks on behalf of investors.\\n  \\n### 4. **Stock Indices**\\nStock indices are a way to measure and report value changes in representative stock groupings. An index is a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of a market. The performance of a stock index gives investors an idea of the market's general direction. Examples include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500, and the Russell 2000.\\n\\n### 5. **Investment Strategies**\\nSome common stock market investment strategies include:\\n- **Value Investing**: Picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.\\n- **Growth Investing**: Investing in stocks of companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to their industry or the overall market.\\n- **Income Investing**: Focusing on stocks that pay high dividends.\\n\\n### 6. **Why Invest in the Stock Market?**\\nInvesting in the stock market can provide a chance for great wealth accumulation. Stocks have historically outperformed most other investments over the long term, although they can be risky in the short term.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy understanding the stock market, economic forces, and business fundamentals, individuals can enhance their chances of investing successfully in stocks.

These activities are conducted through institutionalized formal exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces, which operating under a defined set of regulations. \\n\\nUnderstanding the stock market\\nHere's a simple way to understand the stock market: Picture a farmer's market. Different booths feature different farmers selling their fresh produce and handmade goods. A few farmers share booths and team up to sell complementary products, like jam and bread. It all takes place in a large warehouse where everyone can shop and eat together. \\n\\nThe stock market is a lot like that farmer's market.  There's a place to go - a stock market - where stocks are sold and bought. Many different companies sell stocks of different farmers' markets. Just like the farmer's market, there are booths (stock exchanges) and complementary products (related stocks) to help form a cohesive experience. \\n\\nDespite some similarities, the farmer's market is a little different from the stock market in that it just shows up at specific times or seasons. The stock market is available year-round, and the times it is open varies by country. \\n\\nHow the stock market works\\nThe basic principle behind the stock market is pretty simple: Companies need money to grow, and investors want to make money with their savings. When companies need money, they can borrow it or sell stock to investors. Investors buy stock hoping to sell it later at a profit! \\n\\nCompanies do their best to make sure their stock price goes up because they want to raise as much money as possible when the initial stock is sold. If the stock price rises enough, they will make the most money. They do this by developing really cool products, making money, and then sharing part of those profits with their investors as dividends. Other companies who aren't making money as they grow may not pay dividends. \\n\\nWhen people talk about the stock market, they often only refer to the stock markets of common stocks and preferred stocks. However, it also includes the bond market an important part of the total stock market.  \",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

A financial advisor will help you set investment goals, create an investment plan, and make investment decisions. Advisors can be very expensive and typically take a percentage of your investment every year. If you are just starting and don't have a lot of money to invest, you may want to manage your investments yourself.\\n2. **Decide Where You Want to Invest** - Individual stocks and bonds are not the only things you can invest in. You have many ways to invest. Think about what makes the most sense for you.\\n3. **Choose an Investment Account** - Whenever you buy investments through a brokerage firm, you will do so using an investment account. There are two main types of investment accounts \u2013 taxable and tax-advantaged. A taxable account doesn't give you any special tax treatment. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and money you make when you sell your investments for more than you paid for them. A tax-advantaged account is a type of account that has special tax treatment. The two main types of tax-advantaged accounts are retirement accounts (such as an IRA) and education savings accounts (such as a 529 college savings plan). If you take money out of a retirement account before a certain age, you may have to pay a penalty.\\n4. **Pick an Investment Strategy** - Think about how much you want to invest, how much risk you are comfortable with, and how involved you want to be in managing your investments. There are many different strategies for investing. You may want to:\\n   - **Research stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs -** If you want to buy investments and hold them for several years, learning about how to research stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds may help you make smart decisions.\\n   - **Decide on an investment goal -** Some people choose to invest in stocks and bonds when they are saving for retirement. Others want to save money for a vacation or down payment on a house. When you have a specific goal, you can decide how long you want to invest your money and determine what types of investments will help you meet that goal.\\n   -  **Choose a risk level -** Stocks are usually riskier than bonds. If stock prices go down, investors often decide to sell their stocks to avoid losing money. Long-term investors can think about holding onto their stocks, even when prices go down, since they may go back up again. If you will need the money you are investing in less than five years, you may want to choose safer investments.\\n5. **Start Investing** - Once you plan where to invest, what to invest in, and when, the next step is to actually invest your money. If you are investing for a long-term goal, remember that investing is usually a gradual process. You probably will not save or invest enough money to meet your goal overnight.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"length\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The stock market is a collection of markets where stocks (shares of ownership in businesses) are bought and sold. It's a way for companies to raise money to grow their business by offering ownership shares to investors. The investors, in turn, hope that the companies will do well and their stock will increase in price, so they can sell their shares at a profit. Often, investors also receive a portion of the company's earnings, called dividends.\\n\\nStock markets are made up of all the stocks that are bought and sold on the various stock exchanges and over the counter (OTC) markets in a country. Some of the largest stock markets are in the United States, where the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq set trading records almost every day. Other major stock markets include the London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo stock exchanges. \\n\\nAlso, keep in mind that while investing in stocks can be an effective way to build wealth over the long term, you're unlikely to make money if you invest for just a short time. Your investment should have time to grow.\\n\\n#### Types of stocks  \\nAlthough all stocks represent ownership in a company, there are two broad categories of stock: common and preferred. Common stock usually gives shareholders the right to vote on corporate matters and share in any profit, such as dividends paid. Common shareholders must wait until all the creditors and preferred shareholders are paid before there is anything left for them. Preferred stock normally doesn't come with voting rights, but its holders have a greater claim to the company's assets and earnings than common shareholders do. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders do and are first in line to be paid if a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated. \\n\\nFor more about stocks, common stock, and preferred stock. Also, read about stock indexes.\\n\\n#### What affects stock prices?  \\nThere are many reasons that stocks rise and fall in price. A company's stock price may increase if it earns more profit than expected or if it announces a new product. Selling may increase if a company is named in a lawsuit or its product is delayed.  \\n\\nOften stock prices change because they are driven by what people think will happen, not by what has happened. For example, stock prices may rise in advance of a good report about a company's sales or drop in anticipation of a bad earnings report.  \\n\\nStock prices may also change because of developments in other financial markets, the economy, or political events. For example, if investors around the world decide to sell stocks for whatever price they can get, this will usually cause stock prices to drop. Or, if there is news that a nation's economy is growing quickly, this news may cause stock prices to rise.\\n\\n#### How do stocks make money?  \\nYou can earn money from stocks in two ways: through selling stock for a profit and dividends. When you sell stock for more than you paid for it, you make money. This is called a capital gain. If you hold a stock and its price goes up, you can sell it for a capital gain. If you hold onto your stock and the price goes down, you can still make money when you sell it if you sell it for more than you paid for it. \\n\\nIf you earn dividends, they can either be paid directly to you or reinvested to buy more shares of stock. When you reinvest dividends, you're using the money you earned to buy more stock instead of taking the money out of the company.  \\n\\n#### What to do before you begin buying and selling stocks  \\n- Think about how much you'd like to invest. \\nThink about how long you'd like the money to be invested.  If you expect your money will be tied up for a long time, you might want to invest it in stocks.  \\n- Learn the lingo. \\n  You can become familiar with some basic stock market terms by reading this glossary of investment-related terms. \\n- Practice with a game. \\nIf you want to learn about absorbing the risks without any loss of money, consider a stock market simulation game.\\n\\n#### Learn the basics before you begin  \\nReading how-to articles and books about stocks and talking to financial professionals can help you make the right decisions about buying stocks.   Use the Investment in Your 20s tool and the Investment in Your 30s tool to learn what types of investments may be right for you at this point in your life.   Don't let the lingo or the thought of choosing investments overwhelm you. For instance, if by retirement you plan to live on what you save now, you may want to learn about risk. (This is especially true if you don't have a lot of extra cash, have dependents, or will soon retire). If you're saving for a trip in a few years, you may want to learn about investing in certificates of deposit (CDs) or other low-risk investments. \\n\\n### Getting Started with the Stock Market: 5 Steps    \\n\\n- 1.

It is actually a collection of markets and exchanges where activities like buying, selling, and issuing shares of publicly-held companies occur. Financial assets include stocks and bonds, and other securities. The stock market is where investors go to buy and sell stocks issued by companies.   Buying shares in a company means that you own part of that company. The more shares you own, the bigger your part of the company. Investors buy shares of stock in companies to earn money. When the company does well and earns a profit, it may pay dividends to the stockholders (a person who owns shares of stock). A dividend is a part of a company's profit that is divided among stockholders. or investors. When a company does well, more investors want to buy its stock. When a stock is in demand, its price goes up. So an investor can earn money in two ways: by earning dividends and by selling the stock for more than he or she paid for it.   When you sell a stock for more than you paid for it, the profit is called capital gains. If you sell your stock for less than you paid, you have a capital loss.   The stock market can help a company raise money to invest in its business. When you buy a company's stock, you are giving it money to use in its business. The company can use the money to buy what it needs, such as new equipment. Then it can make more products and earn more money. When a company makes money and people find out about it, they want to buy its stock. The more people want to buy the stock, the higher the price goes.    The stock market goes up and down all the time. When it goes up, people say it is a bull market. When it goes down, they say it is a bear market. Some investors try to buy shares of stock when they think the price is low and sell them when they think the price is high. These investors are called traders.

People buy stocks and other securities in the stock market as a way to invest money and earn a return (profit) on their investments.\\n\\nHere are important things to know: \\n\\nAssets Held For More Than A Year \\n- When you sell an asset (investment), you will report either a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss for that asset, depending on how long you owned the asset before selling it. \\n- For short term capital gains and losses, your basis (purchase price) is the price you pay for the asset. If you sell it for a higher price than your basis, you have a capital gain for that asset. If you sell it for less than your basis, you have a capital loss for that asset. Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income.\\n- For long-term capital gains and losses, your basis is the price you originally paid for the asset. Your base can be increased or decreased depending on special circumstances, such as addition of commission or fees to buy an asset or depreciation. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed at lower rates than short-term capital gains.    \\n \\n\\nMoney In The Stock Market \\n- When you put money into the stock market, you are buying small ownership shares in companies. As the companies make money, you may make money from your investments if you sell those shares for more than you paid for them, or if you receive dividend payments on your shares. Companies use their profits to grow and expand. They may reinvest profits in their business or distribute a portion of their profits to stockholders as dividend payments. \\n- To build wealth over time, you can invest in some kind of the stock market. Investing early and often can yield greater wealth over time. When you invest, you give up access to your money for a the long term which typically is to your advantage. During that time, you may have less chance to react to prevent losses during a market downturn. Over the long term, however, markets have returned about 10% each year. \\n\\nThe Importance Of Risk \\n- With market risk, the value of your investments can go up and down. A bear market refers to a market that has gone down 20% from its recent high point for a sustained period (typically months).

Select a day of the week to plan your meals for the upcoming week. Write down everything you plan to serve for each meal. Look at your calendar to help you remember events, activities, and days when cooking time may be limited.   Consider starting with dinner and then planning breakfast and lunch. Choose a variety of foods so you won't get bored. Write down foods you need to use up, like fruits, vegetables, or leftovers. Put the recipe where you can find it easily.    Plan to make extra food on busy days. Use it for lunch or dinner the next day, or freeze it. Boil extra potatoes, double the salad, or bake a double batch of muffins.     If you're planning meals for others, involve them in the process. They will be more likely to eat healthy meals if they have a say in the planning.    Choose a day of the week to go grocery shopping, and stick to it.         ### 2. Make a grocery list.    Once you have your meal plan for the week, make a grocery list. Check your kitchen, cupboards, refrigerator, and freezer for foods you already have. Buy only the things you need.    To make grocery shopping easier: - Group foods on your list by where they are in the store, such as fruits and vegetables, meats and dairy, and grains. - Check to see if your grocery store has a website. Some stores have meal planning tools and let you create a grocery list online based on your meal plan.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Food labels use serving sizes to show how many calories and nutrients are in one serving. You may want to compare portion sizes to serving sizes.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The 5 food groups\\n                    Choose a variety of foods from all the food groups each day. At meals and snacks, fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables and include foods from the other 3 food groups. Make most of your fats healthy fats, such as olive oil or canola oil. Use the following food groups as a guide for healthy meal planning:\\n                    \\n                     -  Vegetables. Include all vegetables whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Choose a variety of colors and types, such as broccoli, carrots, corn, greens, and peppers. Choose canned vegetables that are low in sodium and do not add sugar to sweetened canned vegetables.    -  Fruits. Include all fruits whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Choose a variety, such as apples, bananas, berries, grapes, and pears. Choose canned fruits that are packed in water or their own juice and not in sugar syrup.    -  Grains. All grains are made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain. Grains are divided into 2 subgroups:         - Whole grains contain the entire kernel. This includes brown rice, whole-wheat bread, quinoa, and oatmeal.      - Refined (processed) grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to improve the shelf life of the grain but also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. Most refined grains are enriched, which means that some of the vitamins and minerals that are removed during processing are added back. Examples of refined grains include white rice and white bread, breakfast cereals, and pasta.        For a healthy meal plan, choose whole grains most often.     -  Protein foods. Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, nuts, seeds, and soy products. Choose lean meats (less than 10% fat), skinless poultry, and seafood. Also choose beans, peas, lentils, nuts, and seeds. Choose nuts and seeds that have not been salted or roasted in oil. Limit red meats and avoid processed meats such as hot dogs and bacon.    -  Dairy. Dairy foods include milk, yogurt, and cheese. Choose low-fat or non-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. If you are lactose intolerant, choose lactose-free milk, yogurt, and cheese. If you do not consume dairy, choose fortified soy milk and yogurt alternatives.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Eat a variety of healthy foods from all three food groups: fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.

To maintain a healthy weight, balance the calories you eat with the calories your body uses.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Build a healthy eating pattern by following these recommendations.\\n                    Make healthy choices from all food groups.     -  Choose a variety of foods. For example, choose different colors of fruits and vegetables.    - Choose a variety of whole grains. For example, eat whole wheat bread, brown rice, and oatmeal.    - Choose a variety of protein foods. For example, eat lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, soy products, nuts, and eggs.         Choose healthful fats.     - Limit saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats are found mostly in animal foods, such as fatty cuts of beef, pork, and lamb; poultry skin; high-fat dairy products, such as whole milk, cream, butter and cheese; and some plant oils, such as palm and coconut oils. Saturated fats can raise blood cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Trans fats are found in hydrogenated oils, some crackers, snack foods, and stick margarines. Trans fats raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol. They increase your risk of heart disease and stroke.       - Aim to eat good fats, like omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce the risk of heart disease and lower blood cholesterol. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines; walnuts; ground flaxseeds; and canola oil.          Select nonfat or low-fat dairy options.    Limit added sugars and sodium (salt) in foods and drinks.     -  Added sugars are found in candy, baked goods, sweetened beverages (like sodas and sugary drinks), and desserts. Foods and drinks with added sugars can add empty calories to your diet and prevent you from getting the vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein that your body needs.    - Sodium is a mineral found in salt and is often used to flavored and preserve foods. Eating too much sodium can increase your risk of high blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 3,000 milligrams (mg) of sodium daily. The average person in the United States eats more than 3,400 mg of sodium every day. Most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods.\\n                   \\n                \\n                    Foods and drinks to increase\\n                    Focus on increasing these foods and drinks:         - Vegetables and fruits (aim for greater than or equal to 2.5 cups each day).     - Whole grains (aim for greater than or equal to 3 ounce equivalents each day).     - Fat-free or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, or cheese (aim for 3 cups each day).     - Protein foods, especially seafood, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, and seeds (aim for greater than or equal to 5.5 ounce equivalents each day).     - Healthy fats, such as olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds.

However, understanding a few basic principles can help ease the process. Investing is a great way to prepare for your financial future. If you are just starting to invest, follow these steps:    \\n\\n\\n1.  **Open an investment account.** To buy stocks, you need to open an individual brokerage account. If you want to invest for retirement, open an individual retirement account (IRA). You can fund both types of accounts with cash. Alternatively, you can open a brokerage account with securities you already own. For most people, a standard brokerage account or a traditional IRA will offer the most flexibility.    \\n\\n\\n\\n2.  **Decide how much to invest.**  Be prepared to invest for the long term. When you invest in the stock market, consider not touching your money for at least five years. If you think you might need it sooner, keep it in a savings account instead. Over the last century, the stock market has increased an average of 10% a year. This is much more than the average savings account will pay you. However, market fluctuations can have a dramatic effect in the short term. If you invest in the stock market for a year or two, you run the risk of losing some of your money.   \\n\\n\\n3.  **Choose your investments.** If you want to be involved in your stock investments, begin researching stocks by reading books, newspapers, and online articles. One approach is to buy stocks in well-established companies with a long record of earnings growth. Consider choosing individual stocks only if you're serious about learning to analyze companies and industries.   Investing in index funds is a good alternative for beginners. An index fund is a collection of stocks that track a specific index. The Standard & Poor's 500 lists 500 large companies in the US. A S&P 500 index fund will invest in stocks based on how much of the total market they compare for example by market capitalization or revenue.   \\n\\n\\n4.  **Decide what type of investor you are.**  Think about how often you want to manage your stocks. A non-active investor may want to invest in target-date funds, which reallocate the fund's investments annually, and robo-advisor accounts. A robo-advisor is a type of low-cost investment manager. It creates a portfolio for you based on your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance and then automatically invests it. If you want a little more control over your stocks, use discount brokers for minimal fees on your stock trades.   Active investors buy and sell stocks to maximize their gains. They research trends and patterns, but nothing they do is guaranteed to work.     \\n\\n\\n5.  **Keep investing.** If you have a 401(k) or other retirement account at work that provides matching contributions, invest enough to qualify for the full match. The match is effectively free money that can help your investments grow. Follow up by using regular deposits to build your investments.    \",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Investing is a fantastic way to grow your wealth over time, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re interested in starting to invest!

What's important is that you take the time to prepare this plan so that you're comfortable investing your money. You can start investing by following four key steps:                                                            \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n  - **Invest in yourself**.         \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n     - Learn the basics of investing. You don't need to know everything about investments before you start investing. However, it can pay to understand the fundamentals. From how to set up an investment account to what stocks and bonds are, there are a wide variety of investing topics to learn about. If you're little intimidated by the thought of investing, that's a sign that you should learn as much as you can before you start. This can help you overcome that intimidation.     \\n     - Understand your goals. One way to start investing is to think about your goals. Your goals will help inform your investment strategy and decisions. For example, if you want to buy a house in the next five years, you likely won't want to invest in riskier stocks that could fluctuate significantly in value in the short term. That could put your goal of buying a house in jeopardy. On the other hand, if you want to invest for retirement that is 30 years away, you may want to invest in stocks that have more risk but have the potential for great long-term growth. The more time between your investment and when you need to use the money, the more risk you may be able to take on.    \\n     - Know your risks. Every investment involves some degree of risk. If you're just starting to invest, you may want to start gradually and be cautious. As you become more comfortable with investing, you can choose to take on greater risks based on your goals.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n - **Plan your investments**.        \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n     - Determine how much money you will need. Knowing how much money you'll need for your goal can help you figure out how long you will need to invest. It can help you plan how much money you should invest and when. If you need the money soon, you may want to invest less aggressively than if you can keep it invested for a long time.     \\n     - Decide on the amount of risk you are willing to take. When investing, you should think about the amount of risk you are willing to handle. Knowing how much risk you're willing to tolerate can help inform your overall investment strategy. Risk can occur in the markets and with individual investments. You may want to consider whether you can tolerate fluctuations in the value of your investments as well as the possibility of losing some or all of your money.     \\n     - Diversify your portfolio. Diversification can help reduce risk. It involves spreading your money among different investments, types of investments, and investment strategies. Choosing a variety of investments can help you lower the risk that a poor-performing investment or investment type will significantly hurt your overall investment portfolio. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or keep your investment from losing value. It can help smooth the ride of ups and downs in the value of your portfolio. Getting familiar with the various investment options can help you think of ways to diversify your portfolio.     \\n     - Assess your timeline. When you set a goal, you'll need to decide on a timeline (the time you will need to reach your goal, both in years and in a start and completion date). This can help inform what investments are best for your goals. Novice investors can use handy worksheets to help with calculating goals like this.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n - **Choose your investment options**.        \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n     Depending on how much you're investing and your overall investment plan, you can choose to use a combination of some of the following investment options.         \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n     - **Employer retirement savings plans**. If you work for an employer that offers a retirement savings plan, consider participating. If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan, you can choose to have your employer deduct money from your paycheck and put it in your retirement savings account. Because you won't receive that money in your paycheck, this may help you save. You may also be able to get free money in the form of employer matching contributions. You may also be able to roll over funds from an old employer retirement plan.     - **IRAs**. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) give you tax advantages for investing for retirement. With a traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct your contributions from your taxes and the investments can grow tax-deferred until you withdraw them in retirement (when you'll pay income tax on the money you take out). With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax income (you don't get a tax deduction), but your investments grow tax-free and you pay no taxes when you withdraw money in retirement.     - **Brokerage accounts**.

Set investment goals\\n                    Before you invest any money, you'll want to establish some investment goals. Ask yourself a few questions: What purpose will this money serve?\\n                        * Are you saving for a one-time expense in the next few years (like a wedding or a vacation)? If so, you'll want to keep your money in a relatively safe place, like a high-yield savings account or a short-term bond fund, so you can minimize any potential loss.\\n                        * Do you want to build wealth over the long-term for retirement or other long-term goals? If you have at least six years before you need the money you're investing, you can afford to take more risk and invest for growth.\\n                        * Do you want generate some income from your investments? If so, you might focus more on bond funds or dividend-paying stocks.\\n                            \\n\\n                    When setting your goals, you will also want to assess your risk tolerance and your time frame for investing.\\n                 \\n                 \\n                    2. Choose an investment style\\n                    In general, there are two main ways to invest: actively or passively.\\n                    - Active investing: Active investors think they can outperform the market by choosing investments (such as stocks, bonds and funds) that they believe are worth more than their current price. Active investors will carefully monitor their portfolios and make changes to their investments in an effort to improve returns.\\n                    - Passive investing: Passive investors typically believe that it's hard to outperform the market, so they invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that track a market index (such as the S&P 500). This strategy is also known as index investing and may combine both passive and active investments.\\n                 \\n                 \\n                    3. Decide where to invest\\n                    If you decide to invest on your own, you have to choose your own investments and where you'll buy them (which is called your investment platform). You can invest in stocks and bonds on a stock exchange through a brokerage account or invest in stock or bond mutual funds through a fund company. You'll want to select an investment platform that meets the needs of the types of investing you plan to do. There are both online brokerages and full-service brokerages.\\n                 \\n                \\n                    4. Understand the basics of stock market investing\\n                    - Stock: A share of a company. When you invest in a stock, you're buying a small piece of that company.\\n                    - Risk: Stocks are generally considered more volatile than bonds or other investments. As a result, they can go up and down more dramatically in price, which means you risk losing money if you sell them when their prices have declined significantly.\\n                    - Rate of return: The rate of return is the amount of money an investment earns, expressed as a percentage of the amount you invested. The historical annualized rate of return, including reinvested dividends, for U.S. stocks is about 10 percent. However, past performance does not guarantee future returns.\\n                    - Diversification: Diversification is the practice of putting your money in a variety of investments. An example of diversification is investing in a mix of stocks, bonds and mutual funds so you have a balanced portfolio. The goal of diversification is to help protect yourself from losing all your money if any one investment goes down in value.\\n                    - Dollar-cost averaging: Dollar-cost averaging is buying the same dollar amount of an investment on a regular basis, such as every month. Since you're buying the same dollar amount, you automatically buy more shares of an investment when its price is low and fewer shares when its price is high. This means your average cost per share may be lower than if you invest a lump sum all at once.\\n                 \\n                 \\n                    5. Start investing\\n                    You can open your investment account at any age, though you will need an adult to open the account if you are under 18. When you are younger, it's easier to save for something small, like a phone or a new video game. You might also save for something huge, like a car or college. But saving for retirement is different. You want retirement to be an amazing time in your life, and the sooner you start saving for it, the more time your money has to grow. The power of compound interest works to your benefit when you don't take your money out. If you are diligent about regularly saving part of your income from a job, you'll have a nice nest egg waiting for you when you retire.\\n                 \\n                 \\n                    6.

Here are some steps you can take to start investing money: \\n\\n1. **Determine your investment goals.** \\n   - Start by thinking about why you want to invest. Whether you're investing to buy a home, save for retirement, or put your kids through college, it helps to make your goals specific and to set a timetable for when you want to reach them.\\n   - Your investment goals will help determine your investment strategy. Be sure to take your personal circumstances into account.\\n\\n2. **Build an emergency fund.**\\n   -  Before you invest, it's smart to have money set aside for emergencies that may come up. An emergency fund can help you avoid having to sell your investments in a pinch.\\n\\n3.  **Pay off high-interest debt.**\\n    - Paying off high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, is one of the best investments you can make. The returns from paying off debt with a high interest rate will almost always exceed the returns you would get investing that money.\\n    \\n4. **Decide how much money you want to invest.**\\n   - You don't have to invest a lot of money to start. Depending on the investment vehicle you choose, you may be able to open an account with a very small amount of money. Consider starting with a smaller amount that won't stretch your budget, then increase your investment over time.\\n   - Keep in mind that any investment carries some risk, including the potential loss of principal you invest. If you are risk-averse, consider investing only what you can afford to lose. \\n\\n5. **Choose an investment account.**\\n   - Depending on your investment goals, you may want to open a taxable account or a tax-advantaged account. If you're investing for retirement, an individual retirement account (IRA) or 401(k) may be a good option. If you're investing to save for college, a 529 plan may be worthwhile. \\n\\n6. **Decide what to invest in.**\\n   - From stocks and bonds to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there are many types of investments to choose from. In general, you may want to consider investing in a mix of different asset classes to help reduce your risk.\\n   - You can invest in assets directly or indirectly through investment vehicles. When you invest directly in stocks, bonds, or real estate, you're buying the asset itself. When you invest indirectly in assets through a mutual fund or ETF, you're buying shares of the fund, which in turn invests the money it collects in a specific group of assets, such as bonds or stocks. \\n\\n7.  **Decide how you want to invest.**\\n    - There are several different ways you can invest your money, including:\\n        - **DIY investing.** If you're interested in researching investments, you may want to build a portfolio of individual stocks and bonds. This can be a fun way to learn about the stock market.\\n        - **Robo-advisors.** If you prefer a hands-off approach, you can open an account at a robo-advisor, an online investment company that offers, in addition to basic services, sophisticated portfolio management and automated trading services, such as automatic rebalancing.\\n        - **Financial advisors.** You may want to hire a financial advisor, an expert who can help you choose investments based on your goals. Keep in mind that financial advisors don't come cheap; many charge fees based on the amount of money they're managing for you.\\n\\n8. **Monitor your investments.**\\n   - Once you've invested your money, check in periodically to see how the investment is doing. However, don't be tempted to frequently buy and sell investments simply because you are anxious about the market. Doing so can prevent you from earning a decent return on your investment.\\n\\n9. **Be tax smart.**\\n   - Make sure you're aware of how taxes can affect your investments. In a taxable account, you will have to pay taxes on any capital gains (the profits you make from selling your investments for more than you paid for them), as well as dividends and interest earned. One option to limit taxes is to invest in index funds, which typically have relatively low turnover, so you pay lower capital gains taxes. \\n\\n10. **Stay the course.**\\n    - Creating a long-term investment strategy and sticking with it will help you reach your financial goals. Times of market volatility can worry even experienced investors. But if you have the right investment strategy and are clear about your goals, you will be less likely to make rash decisions that can derail your long-term plans. \\n\\nIf you're unsure, it can be helpful to consult a financial advisor.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Investing for the first time can be a bit intimidating, but in reality, it can be enjoyable and exciting.

You can choose from several different types of investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. In this article, you will learn steps you can take to make investing part of your plans for a secure financial future.\\n\\nUnderstand how investing works\\nBefore making any investments, you should have a basic understanding of different types of investments and the risks involved in investing.\\n\\nAn investment is the commitment of money or capital to gain a profitable return in the form of interest, income, or appreciation in value. Investors are those who invest money in order to gain a profit.   Investing involves different types of risk. Risk is the chance that an investment's actual return will be different than expected. It is also the chance that you might lose some or all of your investment. Different investments carry different levels of risk. Generally, investments with the potential for the highest returns are also the ones that carry the highest risks.\\n\\nEvaluate your goals\\nEvery investor has different financial needs and goals. Think about your investment goals and why they are important to you. Here are some questions to think about as you evaluate your goals:\\n\\n - What are you investing for? For example, you might want to buy a house, pay for college, or care for your aging parents. Or you might want to have enough money to retire comfortably. Each of these goals will affect how you invest your money.\\n - How old are you? Generally, the younger you are, the more time your money has to grow. If you start investing when you're young, you may be able to earn more money than if you wait until you're older to start investing. If you're older, you may want a more conservative investment approach so you preserve your money for when you need it.\\n -  How much money do you have to invest? Even small amounts of money can add up over time. Start where you are and build your investment portfolio gradually.\\n - When will you need the money? The length of time you expect to wait before you need the money has a big effect on how you invest.  Money you will need to spend in the next few years should be invested in less risky assets, so you won't lose it. Money you won't need until later, such as for retirement, can be invested more aggressively.\\n\\nDecide where to invest\\nThere are some organizations that can help you with investing decisions. These organizations offer a variety of services.\\n\\n -  Financial advisors help you make investing decisions. A financial advisor gives you investment advice and helps you make decisions about investments. Financial advisors work for banks, insurance companies, investment firms, and financial planning firms. It's a good idea to check out several advisors before deciding which one to work with. You can ask friends for a recommendation or try searching the website for a national organization of financial advisors. Be sure to ask about the qualifications and experience of the advisor you choose. Also ask about their fee structure. Some financial advisors charge fees for their services, while others earn money through commissions on the investments they sell you.\\n - Online investment services automate some or all of the investment process. These services are usually less expensive than hiring a financial advisor, but they don't provide personalized advice. For example, some robotic-advisors give you investment advice based on a questionnaire you fill out about your financial situation and goals. Then they invest your money for you.\\n - Educational materials and tools help you learn how to invest. A variety of websites, books, videos, and classes can help you learn the basics of investing. You can ask at your library, school, or community center for suggestions.\\n\\nLearn the basics of investing in stocks\\nThere are several different types of investments. As you get started in investing, it might be a good idea to first learn about stocks, one of the most common forms of investing.\\n\\n - A stock is a type of investment that gives you a share of ownership in a company. An investor purchases stocks (also known as shares or equities) with the hope that the company will do well. If the company makes a profit, it may share some of the profit with its stockholders in the form of dividends. In addition, if the company does well, more people want to buy its stock. When there's greater demand for a stock, its price goes up. If you've purchased shares of that stock, you can sell it for a profit. Stocks can be purchased directly from a company that is selling additional stock or from other investors who have stock to sell. When you make your order, your stockbroker buys or sells stocks for you.   -You may want to ask your insurance or financial advisor if investing in stocks is a good choice for you. You can buy stocks individually or include them in shares in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Investing is a way to allocate your resources, usually money, in order to generate an income or profit.

Investing is a lot like building a house: The more time you take to prepare and plan, the better your house will be. When you invest, you want to build a solid foundation, set clear and realistic goals, and work toward those goals. By preparing and planning for your investments, you will be able to watch your money grow. This guide will help you know where to begin.\\n     \\nThis guide will help you answer these questions:    \\n*  What do I want my investments to achieve?    \\n*  How much money do I need to invest?    \\n*  Where should I open my investment account?     \\n*  What investment options do I have?    \\n*  When should I start investing?        \\n*  How do I know if I'm on track to meet my goals?    \\n*  What do I do once I've started investing?        \\n\\n\\n## What do I want my investments to achieve?\\n       \\nThink before you start investing. Ask yourself:     \\n*  For what purpose am I investing?    \\n*  What is my time horizon (the amount of time I expect to hold an investment before taking the money out)?    \\n*  How do I feel about risk?        \\n\\n\\n### For what purpose am I investing?    \\nInvesting for the long term is a way to help meet your goals. The longer you invest the money, the more time your money may have a chance to grow. It may also help you reach your goals sooner than if you save the money. The power of compounding may help your money grow faster. Compounding is when you earn interest on your principal and on the interest that is added to your principal.     If you are saving for a goal that is just a few months away, such as a vacation or a new car, put your money in a savings account. If you save for your short-term goal with an investment that can go up or down in value, you may not have enough money for your goal when you need it. Short-term goals are best met by saving, not investing.     Common goals that people save or invest for include:      \\n - Buying a new home. Buying a new home is an exciting investment. While having a safe place to live is important, many people also want to build wealth through real estate. But purchasing a home also carries risks.         Over time, homes tend to rise in value. But sometimes home prices drop, which can happen suddenly and without warning.    Buying a home also involves costs\u2014such as mortgage payments, homeowners insurance, property taxes, maintenance, and repairs.    If you buy a home and owe a mortgage (loan) on the home, your monthly payments go toward paying both the loan principal and mortgage interest. When you sell the home, you'll get back the amount you paid on the principal (unless the value of your home has dropped). But you'll never get back the amount you paid in interest.          Not sure how much you can afford? Read Owning Your Home.\\n                \\n- Going to college (or helping a child go to college). If you want to pay for college, be sure to plan ahead. The sooner you start saving for college, the easier it will be for you to meet your goal, and the less you will have to borrow. Be aware that many students borrow large amounts to pay for college.     If your child plans to go to college in the next few years, choose investments that reduce the chance your investments will lose money or that are less likely to lose money. This would include things like cash, short-term bonds, bond funds, and savings accounts.             \\n            \\n * Getting a job.  After you graduate from high school, you may decide to work before you go to college. A good first step in this process is visiting your school's job center for help writing a resume, finding job leads, or practicing for interviews. You also may want to check the help-wanted ads   to get ideas for jobs you want to look for.    This could be a good time to think about college, a trade school, or getting specific job training so you can start your career. If your goal is to find a job, it is probably best to save your money and not invest it.     * Starting a business. If you want to start your own business, it helps to invest your own money. Your business will need cash to pay bills, such as rent, inventory, supplies, and salaries. Be sure to budget for these expenses. Having your own money will allow you to keep your business's debt to a minimum and help you avoid debt yourself. If you don't have a business plan, now is the time to create one.       \\n        \\n ### What is my time horizon?    \\n Your time horizon is a major factor in deciding where to invest your money. In general, the longer you plan to leave your money invested, the more risk you can take.

But it's important to know the basics before you get started, particularly since investments can go up and down in value. This guide will help you understand what investing is and the different options you have.\\n\\n### What is investing?\\nWhen you invest, you buy something because you expect the value of that something will increase over time. Investing is different than saving. Saving is typically for short-term goals and is less risky. When you save, you put your money in a safe place, like a bank account, and earn interest on it. Investing has the potential for higher returns than saving, but also comes with greater risk. When you invest, there's a chance that you could lose the money you invest.\\n\\n### Why should I invest?\\nHistorically, people who invest their money earn a higher return than those who don't invest. By investing your money, you can make it grow and keep up with inflation (when prices go up over time). Investing also helps your money work for you. Instead of waiting to save enough money to buy something you want, investing your money can help you reach your goal sooner.\\n\\n### Tips for getting started\\n\\n1. **Set an investment goal.** What are you investing for - a home, a car, college, or retirement? Different goals may require different ways of investing.\\n2. **Understand the effect of inflation on your savings.** Inflation is when prices go up - making the money you have today worth less in the future. Investing can help you earn more money to keep up with inflation.\\n3. **Learn the difference between saving and investing.** Saving is usually for short-term goals and is less risky than investing. When you save, you put your money in a safe place and earn interest on it. When you put your money in savings, you know how much you'll have when you're ready to use it. Money you invest may increase or decrease in value, so you'll have less - or more - than you'll need when you want to use it for a goal.\\n4. **Think about how much money to invest.** You can start investing with a little money and grow your investments over time. You can invest in stocks in a company, simply by buying some of the company's shares of stock.\\n5. **Plan for the unexpected.** To help reach your goals, make an emergency plan in case things don't go as you expect. Having a plan in place can help you keep moving ahead.\\n\\n### What other resources can I use?\\nThere are many different types of investments including stocks, bonds, real estate, and mutual funds.\\n\\n- **Investing Basics - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission** (PDF) Understand different types of assets you can invest in, how to develop an investment plan, and how to think about risk in investing.\\n- **Choosing Investments - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission** (PDF) Read about different types of investments.\\n- **Investing - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** (PDF) Find out about the different asset classes, how to buy investments, working with financial professionals, and avoiding investment fraud.\\n- **Investing 101: Stock Market Course for Beginners - Learn the Basics | Udemy** Cash back for this program is available.\\n- **Guides and FAQs About Saving and Spending | National Association of Secretaries of State** (PDF) Find guides and FAQs that help you know how to safely spend and save your money.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Investing involves risk, but that's why people invest. The risk of investing is largely associated with the potential of losing money. While you can't completely eliminate risk, you can manage it by understanding different types of investments and how they fit into your overall plan. This guide goes over some of the basic principles of investing and offers tips that can help you start investing.\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n- Think about investing as part of your strategy to reach your financial goals.\\n- Investing is different from saving.\\n-  There are different choices of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and funds.\\n- Establish your risk tolerance to help you choose investments.\\n- Consider your assets and how they affect your investments.\\n- Think about how much money you want to invest initially or how much you want to add over time.\\n- Develop a mix of investments to help manage risk.\\n- Investing always involves risk, including loss of principal.\\n\\n### Think About Investing as Part of Your Strategy to Reach Your Financial Goals\\nBefore you invest, you should think about your other financial goals, make a plan for reaching them, and consider what role, if any, investing should play in helping you reach those goals. Investing generally works best as a way to accumulate wealth over time to achieve long-term financial goals. These goals typically do not have a set date for withdrawal, but when you do take the money out, you hope your investment has grown. Long-term goals are often measured in years. Examples include saving for retirement, a home, or education. Thinking about your goals will help you choose investments and investment accounts that can help you reach them.\\n\\n### Investing is Different from Saving\\n- Saving is short-term and uses the money you need for emergencies or expenses that \u201cmay\u201d occur in the near future. It is usually kept in a savings account that pays a small amount of interest.\\n- Investing is medium- and long-term and is for money you will not need for a long period of time \u2013 at least five years \u2013 if not much longer. In the long run, investments usually earn more than savings.\\n\\n### There Are Different Choices of Investments\\nSome common types of investments are:\\n- **Stocks**. You can buy shares of companies through stock markets like the New York Stock Exchange. When the company earns money, it may share some of those earnings with shareholders in the form of dividends. Over time, stocks have historically earned the highest returns compared to other types of investments. The trade-off is that stocks can also lose money quickly.\\n- **Bonds**. When you buy bonds, you are lending money to a company or the government. They pay you interest over a set time, and then you get your money back. Bonds tend to be less risky than stocks but their returns are often also lower.\\n- **Investment funds**. Investment funds include **mutual funds**, **exchange-traded funds**, and **real estate investment trusts**. These funds allow many investors to group their money to buy stocks, bonds, real estate, or other assets.\\n- **Cash equivalents** like money market accounts pay lower returns than bonds and stocks. The principal is less likely to fluctuate in value.\\n\\n### Create a portfolio that will meet your needs\\nA portfolio is a collection of your investments. The exact mix of different types of investments will depend on your goals, how soon you need the money, and your tolerance for risk.\\n\\n### Establish Your Risk Tolerance to Help You Choose Investments\\nYour ability to endure risk will help you decide the right mix of investments. Ask yourself: How do you feel about your portfolio losing money? How would you react if the stock market dropped a lot and caused your investments to drop in value? Every investor needs different types of investments, and their preferences are driven by:\\n- Age. Young investors usually have time to recover from downturns in the market. They can probably afford to take some risks. Older investors may want less risk and a regular income from their investments.\\n- Personality. Some people feel anxious about risk. Other people are willing to take risks and don't worry so much. You can consider even out your portfolio with different types of investments.\\n- Purpose of the investment. The less time you have to reach a goal, the less you probably want to risk losing the money you will need to reach that goal.\\n\\n### Consider Your Assets and How They Affect Your Investments\\nYour assets are another important factor in deciding how to invest. You may want to invest differently if your assets already include a lot of real estate or if you're inheriting money that you plan to invest.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Investing means putting your money into something with the expectation of making more money.

The sooner you start, the sooner you can earn money on your investment earnings. This is called the power of compound earnings. To make the most of it, you can:         *  Invest small amounts regularly rather than a large amount all at once. For example, instead of waiting to save $1,000 to invest, invest what you can each month, and build up from there. Your investment will start earning returns right away on the money you invest.    *  Reinvest your earnings. Leave your investment earnings in your account to earn even more money.

You can:         * Stick with low-cost, simple investments, such as index funds or exchange-traded funds. Or consider using a robo-advisor.     * Keep in mind that investments are not all or nothing.

Create a mix of investments. When you start investing, consider creating a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash to spread your risk and increase your chances for growth.    2.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your investments as you build your portfolio can help lower your investment risk. Combining different kinds of investments can improve your returns without taking on too much risk.    3.  Keep learning as you go. Investing can be complicated. As a new investor, give yourself time to learn about investing before investing a lot of money.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Don't be afraid to seek out help\\n                    Consider hiring a financial professional if you don't want to manage your investments or want more help.

Want to learn more about investing? These steps can help you start investing your money in a way that will help you grow it over time. \u00a0The benefits of investing early and often, even small amounts\\nInvesting is the act of allocating resources, usually money, in order to generate income or profit. With investing, you put your money to work today in order to receive more money in the future. There are many ways to invest, such as buying stocks or real estate properties. Investing is risky but, if done correctly, can lead to wealth and financial security. The sooner you invest money, the more time it has to grow. This is especially true when you consider compound interest, which is the interest on an investment that is calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.   \u00a0When you invest, you put your money to work so it can earn more money for you. When you earn interest on your savings, your money keeps growing. Over time, compounding can help your money grow exponentially.   \u00a0For example: * You put money in a savings account. After the first year, you have $100. After the second year, you have $110. And after the third year, you have $121. * If instead, you invested that money and received a 10% return on your investment each year, then after three years, you\u2019d have $133.10 instead of $121. \u00a0  \u00a0 Investing also helps you build wealth so you can plan for your financial future, such as buying a home or saving for retirement.   \u00a0Relying on savings alone may leave you short of your financial goals. It's typically a good idea to invest money that you won\u2019t need for at least five years.\\n    \u00a0How to start investing\\nTo get started, consider these steps:   1. **Determine your investing style.** You may choose to invest as an individual or as a part of a workplace retirement plan.     * As an **individual investor**, you can buy and sell securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Be sure to use safe online tools to protect your personal information when you invest online.     * As part of a **workplace retirement plan,** you can choose to invest for retirement through employer-sponsored plans, such as a 401(k). Some employers will match their workers' contributions up to a certain percentage of an employee's salary. This is essentially free money, and it's typically a good idea to contribute enough to get the full benefit of the match.     If you're not sure what to do, think about working with a certified financial planner. A financial planner can help you learn good investing practices and explore your investment options. Be sure to check out the *Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)* website at www.finra.org for information about investment professionals.       2. **Determine your investing goals.** Review your financial goals, such as investing for retirement, a home or college, and when you will need the money. Your goals will impact how you invest. Investing for a goal that is years away will look different than investing for a goal within the year.       3. **Create a strategy.** Your investment strategy should be based on your goals, your timeline for reaching them and your risk tolerance. The level of risk you can tolerate will be different for each investment goal. You can manage risk by diversifying your investments so they aren't all tied to one type of investment, company, or industry.   Your timeline is when you will need the money you invest. This can affect how you invest and how much risk you can take. If, for example, you are investing for retirement that is 30 years away, you can handle more risk since you have time for your investments to recover from any losses. If you need the money within the next two years, you may want to invest more conservatively to lessen the risk of losing your money.   \u00a0   \u00a0 If you are investing for short-term goals (less than three years), you may want to consider less risky options such as savings accounts, CDs or bonds. If you are investing for longer-term goals (three years or more), consider stocks and mutual funds. Stocks and mutual funds can have higher risks, but also offer the potential for higher returns over time.      4. **Pick your investments.** Deciding what to invest in will be based on your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. You can research different investment options on your own, or work with a financial planner who can help you choose. You can reduce your risk by diversifying your investments among different companies, industries, and even asset classes. Long-term investments, such as stocks and equity-based mutual funds, generally offer the greatest potential for growth but\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

You can ensure the best work possibilities by creating a comfortable, professional environment in your home and avoiding distractions. Here are some tips to help you remain productive while working from home:\\n### 1. Set Up Your Environment\\n- **Choose a specific place to work:**  Avoid working in bed or on your couch with your laptop. Instead, settle into a quiet room, such as an office, spare bedroom, or a corner of your living room. Make it comfortable, where you can sit for hours but also professional, without distractions. \\n- **Make your workspace organized:** Keep anything on your desk that inspires you or reminds you of your goals. Remove anything that can distract you, like your phone. \\n- **Ensure good lighting:** Use natural sunlight whenever possible. If you are working primarily after dark, get a lamp with a warm bulb that mimics natural light. \\n### 2. Get Dressed for Work\\n- **Dress like you would when going to the office:** Putting on regular clothes can signal to your brain that it's time to work instead of to relax. You don't have to wear a full suit but aim for comfortable, business-casual clothing. \\n- **Groom yourself:** Wash your hair, brush your teeth, and put on some makeup or cologne if that is part of your normal routine. It will help you feel awake and productive. \\n### 3. Stick to Your Normal Routine\\n- **Set your work hours:** Try to work the same hours that you normally would in an office. Be diligent in sticking to them. \\n- **Take breaks:** Your brain can only focus for so long. Schedule regular breaks so that you step away. Whether it's to grab a snack or go for a walk, fully disengage for a little while. \\n- **Plan tasks for the following day:** Keep a notebook or calendar that outlines what you want to complete. Before finishing work for the day, write out your plan for what you will work on first when you resume. \\n### 4. Focus On Work Rather Than Distractions\\n- **Avoid distractions:** Reduce opportunities for interruptions as much as possible. Let those around you know when you are working so they aren't as likely to distract you. \\n- **Limit time on social media and forums:** While it might seem good to unplug and visit social media for a few minutes, it can consume a lot of your time. Set strict limits on how long you will spend scrolling or chatting online. \\n### 5. Communicate Effectively\\n- **Be responsive:** If your normal routine includes having meetings with customers or clients, try to continue scheduling these while working at home. Complete everything you can in your work hours rather than leaving it for the weekend to catch up on.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Staying productive while working from home can be a challenge, especially if you are not accustomed to working in a remote environment.

The ideal routine varies from person to person, depending on individual preferences and obligations, but a good morning routine has some common elements. You can start creating a morning routine by incorporating your preferred elements gradually. Here\u2019s how to get started:    ### 1. Wake Up Early and Consistently    - **Choose your wake-up time**: Think about how many hours of sleep you need and set your morning alarm to include those hours. Consider getting up at the same time each day for consistency.    - **Avoid snoozing**: Get out of bed when your alarm goes off to start your day sooner.    - **Limit early distractions**: Any time you spend checking your phone, watching tv, or listening to podcasts takes away from your morning routine.    ### 2. Hydrate    - **Drink water**: After a night without food and water, your body needs some hydration. Drink a glass of water first thing.    ### 3. Make Your Bed     - **Start your routine with one productive task**: This helps you feel accomplished at the beginning of the day.    ### 4. Nourish Yourself    - **Eat breakfast**: A healthy breakfast can give you energy and nutrients to make better choices throughout the day. If you prefer to eat breakfast later, just ensure you have some food within a few hours of waking up.    - **Avoid excessive caffeine and sugar**: These might give you a temporary boost of energy but can lead to an energy crash later in the day.    ### 5. Exercise    - **Incorporate movement**: Morning exercise can help energize you and increase productivity throughout the day. You could take a walk, do yoga, or pick a workout that you enjoy.    ### 6. Prepare for the Day    - **Make a short to-do list**: Plan your important tasks or appointments for the day.    - **Choose your clothes**: Deciding on an outfit in advance saves time and energy in the morning.    - **Practice mindful breathing**: Spend a few minutes practicing mindfulness through breathing exercises or meditation.    ### 7. Limit Decision Fatigue     - Aim to keep your morning routine short, simple, and consistent so you have energy left for more important decisions later in the day.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Creating a good morning routine can set a positive tone for your entire day.

You can build your ideal morning routine by encouraging habits that focus on wellness and fitness, self-care, and productivity. Looking at your values and goals can also help you create a routine that is right for you.   Wellness and fitness Morning routines can include habits that motivate you to take care of your physical and mental health.  *  Rise and shine. Healthy sleep habits can help you get a good night's sleep. Waking up at the same time every day can also help you fall asleep at bedtime. Avoid using digital devices too close to bedtime.    *  Eat breakfast. Healthy eating can help you feel your best, have more energy, and reduce your risk for certain diseases. Make breakfast nutritious by eating fruit, whole grains, dairy, and protein. Avoid foods loaded with sugar, trans fat, or sodium.    *  Move your body. Exercise is linked to many health benefits, including lower stress and anxiety. It can boost your mood, help you sleep better, and improve your confidence. You do not have to work out for long to reap the benefits. Any physical activity can help. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk your dog around the block, or dance to your favorite song.    *  Stay hydrated. You may get dehydrated while you sleep. Try to drink a glass of water in the morning.   Self-care You can give yourself a good start to the day with some time spent on self-care.  * Avoid morning stress. Make your mornings run smoother by doing things the night before. Plan how you will get where you need to be on time. Choosing your clothes the night before, packing a lunch, and getting ready for bed can help you avoid the morning rush.    * Be mindful. Times of stress or worry can lead to feelings of being out of control and overload. Mindfulness can help reduce stress by allowing you to become aware and reflect on what you are feeling. With practice, daily mindfulness can become a habit.    * Smile. Smiling, even when you do not feel like it, can help improve your mood. Try to remember something that makes you happy.    *  Take breaks from tech. Technology can play a large part in our daily lives. Building breaks from tech into your mornings can help ground you without distractions.   Productivity You can build the foundation for a productive day with daily habits.  *  Make a plan. A daily \\\"to do\\\" or action list can help you remember your obligations and guide you through your day. Setting goals can help keep you on track and focused.     * Stay organized. Staying organized at work and having a clean space can help you get more done. Plan time at home and at work to tidy your space so you do not fall behind each week.    *  Get inspired. Find ways to get and stay inspired and motivated. Reading, listening to music, or watching a favorite show might give you the boost you need to stay motivated.

Here are some time-management strategies and tips that you can use:\\n\\n### Tips for Organizing Your Time\\n1. **Identify Time Wasters.**  Think about what areas of your life waste your time the most. Maybe it's scrolling through your social media feed or getting distracted by YouTube videos. If you can find ways to eliminate tasks or use your time more efficiently, you'll have more time for what matters.\\n2. **Write a Daily Schedule.** Think about what you need to accomplish each day and write it down. Be sure to include your commitments, such as classes, jobs, and family obligations. Also include blocks of time for studying, homework, or other tasks, as well as time to have fun and relax.\\n3. **Prioritize Tasks.** For each task in your schedule, ask yourself: \\\"How important is this?\\\" and \\\"When does this need to be done?\\\" You can make the habit of labeling tasks as \\\"A\\\" (very important), \\\"B\\\" (important but not urgent), or \\\"C\\\" (not important) to help you prioritize.\\n4. **Be Flexible.** Your schedule should be a living document that may change as you go. If something happens, look at whether you can move tasks from one part of your schedule to another. If you're having trouble getting something done, such as reading for class, think about other strategies you can try, such as reading it aloud or working with a classmate.\\n5. **Start with Little Things.** If you have a big project or goal, break it down into small tasks that are easier to manage. For example, if you have a long paper to write, make an outline as one task, write the rough draft as another task, and so on until you finish.\\n6. **Use Timers.** To help yourself stay focused, try setting a timer for a specific amount of time and working on a task for that long. When the time is up, take a short break. You can keep working, if you'd like, but try to not let distractions pull you away from the task.\\n\\n### Using Technology to Manage Your Time\\nAnother option for improved time management is to use technology. Here's a list of ideas:\\n- **Digital Calendars.** Set up a calendar program to help you manage your time. You might choose a calendar on your computer or even an app on your smartphone or tablet. Look for one that can send you reminders for upcoming tasks, such as a calendar that can text you alerts.\\n- **Task Managers.** Install task management tools on your phone or computer to help keep track of your tasks and schedule. Programs like Todoist or Microsoft To Do let you record tasks and deadlines and also prioritize them.\\n- **Script Your Day.** If you find it hard to stick to a schedule, consider using your phone or other device to record your daily outline and take periodic check-ins on it. For example, you could record an alert at 6 PM to remind you it's time for dinner.\\n\\nTime management is a skill you can develop through hard work and practice.

After putting together your goals, make a list of what you have to do. Not all of the demands on your time are equally important. Deciding what is most important will help you find the time to do it. Think about the following when choosing your priorities.\\n    - Will this allow me to reach my goal?\\n    - Is this something I need to do now? Will I be in trouble if I don't do it, or will I lose out on a big chance? It is often good to get things done that are due soon.

When you're empathetic, you can understand what someone else is feeling. You can feel their pain and imagine how it affects them. Empathy can be further divided into:\\n  - **Affective empathy**: The capacity to respond with an appropriate emotion to another's mental states.\\n  - **Cognitive empathy**: The capacity to understand another's perspective or mental state.\\n    - Cognitive empathy is sometimes distinguished from affective empathy, and sometimes viewed as a component of affective empathy.

Here's a look at the difference between empathy and sympathy, and some tips on how to show empathy. \\n### Difference between empathy and sympathy\\nEmpathy involves feeling with someone \u2014 it means you are able to put yourself in their shoes. Sympathy, on the other hand, involves feeling for someone \u2014 it makes you feel pity or sorrow for someone's misfortune. Here\u2019s an analogy to illustrate the difference: if two people are shopping for shoes and one is looking at stilettos but his feet hurt, he might think, \\\"Those shoes are going to hurt when I wear them. I don\u2019t want to hurt my feet.\\\" This is sympathy. On the other hand, a friend who is watching that shopper might think, \\\"Those stilettos are going to hurt my friend. She really loves shoes, but she\u2019ll be in so much pain if she buys those.\\\" This is empathy. \\n### Tips for showing empathy \\nYou can improve your ability to empathize with others. Here are some things to try: \\n \\n- **Listen actively.** Pay careful attention to what is being said. Don\u2019t just think about what you want to say next. Use verbal and nonverbal signals to show that you are listening, such as nodding and using affirming words.\\n- **Make a connection.** Share with the person what they said brought something to mind for you. Don\u2019t compare it directly to your own experience, but you might find a small piece of commonality if you give it a try. For example, \\\"That happened to me once and it was such a rough day!\\\" \\n- **Be there.** Sometimes the best you can do is to show support. This might mean just sitting quietly and being available. \\n- **Ask questions.** Asking questions can help clarify what the other person means and show them that you care about what they are saying. You might say, \\\"Can you tell me more about that?\\\" or \\\"What was that like for you?\\\" \\n- **Respect feelings.** People respond to situations differently. Just because their feelings don\u2019t match yours does not mean they are wrong. Show that you accept their feelings as valid for them.\\n- **Share feelings.** Letting a person know how what they said affects you can create connection. For example, \\\"Hearing that makes me sad,\\\" or \\\"That story of your dad touched my heart.\\\"\\n- **Watch your tone.** Nonverbal signals can sometimes send a clearer message than words. Check to see if how you say something matches the message you want to convey. Your tone and attitude are important. \\n- **Avoid comparisons.** Resist the urge to share stories about your own experiences. You want the other person to be sharing and expressing, and they may not feel heard if they think you are trying to top their story.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

The internet is a vast network of linked computers and other devices that communicate with each other using common communications protocols. The first computer networks, which eventually became the internet, were created in the 1960s. The internet gained widespread use in the 1990s, and has changed the way people communicate, learn, work, and shop.    Prehistory and development of the ARPANET The idea of communicating through computer networks became feasible with computer technology that emerged in the 1950s and '60s. In 1961, computer engineer Leonard Kleinrock published the first paper stating that data could be sent over a network in small packets, and that such data traveling over a single wire could take different paths to reach the same destination. This idea was important to the development of computer networks. It was the foundation of technologies such as TCP/IP, packet switching, and ultimately the internet. In 1962 MIT psychologist J.C.R. Licklider began development of a global network of computers and described an \\\"Intergalactic Network\\\". Licklider became the first head of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), which help fund projects that eventually led to the development of the internet.    In October 1966, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) began to develop a network of computers that could share data and resources. This network, known as the ARPANET, connected four major computers: the University of California, Los Angeles; the Stanford Research Institute; UC-Santa Barbara; and the University of Utah. One of the project managers was a reclusive computer scientist named Robert Kahn. In 1969, the first successful message was sent over the ARPANET, from UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute.   In 1970, the first computer-to-computer chat program was developed on the ARPANET at Stanford and was called \\\"SIMPLE.\\\"    Creation of access centers In 1971, Ray Tomlinson of Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), an outside contractor for ARPA, invented email as a way for multiple users of a single computer to communicate with each other. Tomlinson is also credited with the use of the @ symbol to separate the user name from the computer name in email addresses. Soon afterward, a group of ARPANET users began writing a central directory of users and computers on the network. They called it a \\\"web\\\" and the name stuck.   Development of the internet protocol suite By 1971 the original ARPANET had grown to approximately 15 systems and continued to expand in the next several years. In 1973, noted computer scientist Vinton Cerf began to develop the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a set of communications protocols that allows digital computers to communicate over long-distance lines. TCP breaks up messages into packets, which are then routed over the network and reassembled at their destination. IP provides a unique address where the packet is delivered. In 1983, ARPANET switched to using TCP/IP.   Growth of the internet The first major international conference on the internet was held in 1972. The number of members of the Internet Engineering Task Force grew to more than 500 by the end of the 1970s.   Birth of the World Wide Web    The next major development came in 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The web, which expanded enormously after it was made available for free to users in 1993, is a system of web pages that may contain text, sounds, and graphics. It is however only one of the services on the internet. Others include email, chat, bulletin boards, and file transfer.   Commercialization of the internet The National Science Foundation (NSF) began to take steps in 1986 to develop high-speed telecom lines. The NSFNET was initialized in 1986, linking six super computer centers: three in California, one each in New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts. In 1988, the NSF received the second of a two-year grant to conduct internet research and commercialization of the internet. In December 1995, after NSFNET ceased to be the center of the internet, the number of estimated internet users became 24 million.   Growth and globalization of the web    The web was quickly adapted for use in various countries, even those that did not use the Latin alphabet. For example, by 1992 in China, a text-based version of the web was developed, which could utilize the Chinese language. These developments made the web even more popular worldwide.    In less than five years (19941999), the number of users (web browsers) grew from only 16 million to 388 million. By 1996, thousands of businesses had established a web presence.

It is important to evaluate the information you find online by considering the information's source, checking the date it was posted, comparing it with information from other sources, and verifying the facts with an expert. You should also be aware that some information is not true and is meant to trick or mislead readers. These tips can help you to stay safe and secure when you are using the internet.   -  **Use strong passwords.** A strong password is a word or phrase that has at least 12 characters and includes letters (both upper and lowercase), numbers, and symbols. Change your passwords at least once a year.   -  **Use up-to-date software.** Make sure antivirus and antispyware software is running and that you receive regular updates so that your computer can continue to protect you from viruses and other malware.   -  **Be private and secure.** If you use social media, check your privacy settings to find out who can view, share, and comment on what you post.\\n\\n                    If you're not sure whether a website is safe to use, here are some tips:   - In the search bar at the top of your browser, look at the URLs of sites you do not recognize. They may have misspellings, strange symbols, or extra words.   - Check to see whether a website is secured with HTTPS in the web address. If you see HTTP (without the \\\"s\\\"), the site may not be secure.   - Look for a lock icon in the address bar or at the start of the website's URL.   - Do not give out identifying information, such as your name, where you live, or your phone number, unless you are sure that the website is safe.\\n\\n                    You can learn more about using the internet safely with these resources: -  [net:: soul](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/net-soul/) -  [OnGuardOnline.gov](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/online-security)\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Explore these resources to learn more about the history of the internet and how it has impacted society.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

ARPANET was the first network to implement the packet switching protocol, a key technology for the development of the internet. The first message was sent over ARPANET in 1969, connecting four university computers.\\n\\n2. **TCP/IP Protocol (1970s)**: In the 1970s, computer scientists Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf developed Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). This suite of communication protocols allowed different networks to interconnect and communicate with each other, a fundamental principle of the internet. In 1983, ARPANET adopted TCP/IP, and the network officially became known as the \\\"internet.\\\"\\n\\n3. **First Email and Domain Name System (1970s - 1980s)**: In 1971, Ray Tomlinson sent the first email over ARPANET. The idea of email as we know it, with the \\\"@\\\" symbol to separate the user name from the computer name, was developed by Tomlinson. In 1984, the Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced, allowing users to access computers using easy-to-remember names instead of numeric IP addresses.\\n\\n4. **World Wide Web (1989 - 1991)**: The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN. The first website went online in 1991, offering information about the web project. The web made the internet more accessible to the general public by allowing users to view and navigate multimedia content using a web browser.\\n\\n5. **Commercialization of the Internet (mid-1990s)**: In the mid-1990s, various internet service providers began offering services to individuals and businesses, leading to rapid growth in the number of internet users. The National Science Foundation lifted restrictions on the commercial use of the internet, and businesses began to establish a presence online.\\n\\n6. **Dot-com Boom and Bust (late 1990s - 2000)**: The late 1990s saw a surge in the creation of internet-based companies, known as the dot-com boom. Many of these companies went public and saw their stock prices soar. However, in 2000, the bubble burst, leading to a rapid decline in stock prices and many companies going out of business, in what is known as the dot-com bust.\\n\\n7. **Rise of Web 2.0 (2000s)**: The 2000s brought a shift in how people used the internet, from static content to user-generated content, social networking, and collaboration. This new phase is often referred to as Web 2.0, characterized by websites that encourage user interaction and sharing, such as social media platforms, blogs, and wikis.\\n\\n8. **Broadband and Mobile Internet (2000s - 2010s)**: High-speed internet connections, known as broadband, became widely available in the 2000s, allowing users to download and upload data much faster than with earlier dial-up connections. The proliferation of mobile devices in the 2010s, such as smartphones and tablets, led to a significant increase in mobile internet usage, with more people accessing the internet through their devices instead of traditional computers.\\n\\n9. **Expansion and Diversity (2010s - present)**: The internet continued to expand, with more than half of the world's population using it by 2020. This expansion included increased access in developing regions and a rise in the use of social media, online video streaming, and cloud computing. At the same time, issues such as privacy, cybersecurity, and the digital divide became more pressing concerns. The rapid growth of the internet also led to its own problems, including cyberbullying, harassment and the rise of online-trolling, fake news and catfishing.\\n\\n10. **Increased Regulation and the Future (2020s - present)**: Governments and organizations around the world began taking steps to regulate the internet more heavily for the protection of users against scams, hate speech, and illegal behavior; to prevent the spreading of misinformation; and to encourage competition. These regulatory changes affected platforms including social media sites, online marketplaces, and search engines, while also sparking debates about freedom of speech and censorship.\\n\\nOverall, the history of the internet is a story of technological advancement and social change, shaping how we communicate, access information, and connect with each other around the world.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate freely and share and exchange information.

The Internet: An Overview     The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks that use a set of standards, known as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), to link billions of computers worldwide. It is a network of networks that connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, from local to global in scope.   The Internet carries a vast array of information resources and services, including the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.      How Does the Internet Work?     The Internet consists of millions of computers that are connected to each other using telephone lines, fiber optic cables, or satellites. When your computer connects to the Internet, it becomes part of a network of computers from all over the world.   The computers on the Internet are connected by a special set of rules that allow them to communicate with each other. These rules are called \\\"protocols\\\" and the most commonly used protocol is called TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.   TCP/IP is the basic communication language of the Internet. It is a set of rules or standards that governs how data is transmitted over the Internet between computers. Whenever you send an email or open a web page, you are using TCP/IP.   Each computer connected to the Internet has a unique address called an \\\"IP address\\\". An IP address is a series of four numbers separated by periods (for example: 123.45.67.89) or a series of eight characters separated by colons (for example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).   A domain name is the name used to identify a website. The domain name system (DNS) is a service that translates the domain names used by people into IP addresses that computers can understand.      Development of a Networked Society     The Internet has changed the way people communicate, acquire information, and conduct business. As more people went online, commercial enterprises began to establish a presence on the Internet.   In the late 1980s, only about 1,000 people regularly used the Internet. By 1991, that number had grown to around 100,000, and by 1998, there were more than 100 million users. Individuals and businesses connect to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as a regional telephone company, a cable television company, or a specialized ISP offer one or more kinds of connections, including basic telephone dial-up service, DSL, fiber-optic connections, cable modems, T-1 lines, or satellite links.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"A good place to start is at the Internet History Homepage, which includes links to a variety of materials about the history of the Internet.\\nYou can also find the following recommended resources online.

In 1969 the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) funded the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to develop a network, called ARPANET, that would link scientists and university researchers around the country. The first successful message sent over ARPANET traveled from the ARPA office in Washington, D.C., to a computer at UCLA on October 29, 1969. By 1971, ARPANET connected 15 computers. In 1973, the DOD contracted with Paul Baran, a researcher at the RAND Corporation, to develop a communications network that could withstand a nuclear attack. Barans proposal for a decentralized network based on a distributed communications system became the basis for todays internet.   Other researchers began to devise communication protocols to allow ARPANET to connect with other computer networks. In 1974, Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which became the standard communication protocol for ARPANET. In 1983, TCP/IP was declared the official protocol for ARPANET, and the network was split into two networks: ARPANET and the new Internet.     Universities, government agencies, and corporations began to connect their networks to the new Internet in the late 1980s and the World Wide Web became popular in the 1990s. Until then, most Internet users in the United States had been academic researchers and scientists. In 1989, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) created a supercomputer network linking five national supercomputer centers at university sites. These were found at the University of California, San Diego; Cornell University; the University of Illinois; the University of Michigan; and Princeton University. With NSF funding, interconnecting networks were eventually formed that linked academic, government, and commercial computer networks. The resulting system became known as NSFNET.    The World Wide Web began as a project of Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working as a contractor at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) near Geneva, Switzerland. He proposed an information management system based on the linking of documents that use hypertext (text that contains links to related content). He also developed the first web browser and server software to create the first Web page in 1990 at CERN. In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT to develop standards for the web.    By 1993 there were an estimated 23,500 websites. Internet use became increasingly widespread with the advent of user-friendly web browsers. Three of the most popular early web browsers were Netscape, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. By 1994, more than 100,000 websites had been created.   Web media is the term used to describe the wide array of websites and webpages available online. Web media may consist of several mixed media types, such as text, audio, images, animations, streaming video, and interactive content. In November 1993, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, students at the University of Illinois, developed the Mosaic web browser that allowed users to display graphics and text on the same page. This aided the rapid growth of web media on the internet.   In 1995 alone, the fastest-growing businesses were online services and Internet service providers (ISPs). Online services allowed subscribers to interact over the internet to exchange messages, share files, and access news and blogs. ISPs help people connect with online services and provide digital technology for links.     By the end of 1999 there were more than 200,000 websites.

Global connections, 2000s to present.\\n \\n The ARPANET era, 1960s and 1970s\\nThe Internet as we now know it began with the development in the late 1960s of a packet switching network known as the ARPANET. The project was funded by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The goal was to explore ways to facilitate electronic communications among various agencies and research centers associated with the U.S. military and other government offices. The ARPANET became the first network to make use of the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).  The first host connected to the ARPANET was a computer at UCLA, which in September 1969 communicated with a second computer at Stanford Research Institute. In the ensuing months, the network grew to fifteen nodes, including universities and research centers in the United States and one in London.    From the ARPANET, other research networks were created, including the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), an important research and education project that eventually connected thousands of academic and research institutions. By the early 1990s, an estimated 1,000,000 hosts had connected to various networks.   The ARPANET used the Network Control Protocol (NCP). In 1974 Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the first proposals for TCP. NCP was replaced by TCP/IP on the ARPANET on January 1, 1983.\\n \\n The early development of protocols and networks, 1970s and 1980s\\nThe emergence of common protocols enabled digital communication regardless of the kind of computer or operating system used. This period also saw the founding of several professional and user groups interested in sharing knowledge, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, which established standards for Internet protocols. The 1970s also saw the creation of e-mail as early as 1971.\\n \\n The period of networks, 1980s\\nVarious networks were established in this era, notably Usenet and BITNET.  The first successful connection of an Apple Macintosh computer to the Internet was made by the University of Toronto in 1986.    The first Internet domain name, symbolics.com, was registered on March 15, 1985.    In 1987 the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was established to connect supercomputers at various universities across the United States for scientific research and to promote resource sharing among institutions.     In 1988 the first worm came into being and spread across the network; it shut down about 10 percent of the Internet.\\n \\n The commercialization of the Internet, 1990s\\nAs the interconnection of different networks (or internetworking) grew, the term Internet became commonly used to describe the global network.   The World Wide Web dramatically expanded the range of information available to Internet users. Led by Tim Berners-Lee, the first web server and browser was created by a group at the CERN research facility in Geneva. The first commercial web browser, Mosaic, made its debut in 1993 and became widely popular.    Development of online advertising in 1994 opened the way for businesses to make money from the Web. By 1999 there were an estimated 150 million people using the Internet worldwide.    The rise of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s led to much excitement, with optimism about its potential and a frenzy of investment and speculation. By the end of the decade, some early expectations had been fulfilled, while others soured or fell flat.    In 1999, the report of a summit on the digital divide issued stark warnings about the inequality of Internet access.\\n \\n Global connections, 2000s to present\\nBy 2019 an estimated 4.5 billion people were using the Internet. The growth of mobile devices contributed to the globalization of the Internet. The broadband network expanded as systems for transmitting voice and images improved and as computers, wireless devices, cables, satellites, and technologies to improve efficiency of transmissions all became more interconnected across the globe.     Early years of social media included a number of platforms.

A video about the history of the internet:         The internet is the most powerful and widespread communications tool ever created.     In the early 1970s, computer scientist Vinton Cerf helped develop a communications tool called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which became the standard data transmission protocol used on the Internet. TCP set the rules for how data was broken down into packets, transmitted over the network, and received on the other side. Internet Protocol, called IP, defined how addresses and routing of the data packets would occur. The combined protocol became TCP/IP.    In 1985, more than 2,000 host computers were linked to the Internet, and their number grew exponentially in the following years. In 1993, the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) browser called Mosaic was released by Marc Andreessen and others at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. Mosaic made the Internet much easier to access for everyone, and soon the number of people online exploded.    By the end of the 1990s, the Internet was a vital communications channel that linked millions of computers all over the world.     See the Appendix for a list of people who contributed to the development of the Internet.        Nineties Growth      In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web (WWW) to the Internet. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, the Internet exists separately from the World Wide Web. Websites and other information are hosted on servers on the Internet. People can access that information using browsers such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. The web is built on hypertext, which allows users to click on links to access writing, images, music, and other data. It also is built on hypermedia, which allows the links to have more than just text.     The World Wide Web began in 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee uploaded the first website on a server at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva. He offered it to the organization\u2019s employees in the fall of 1991 and then released it publicly on August 6, 1991.   A decision to release the web technology freely to anyone served as an essential milestone in explosive Internet growth. In the early 1990s Marc Andreessen and other NCSA staff developed Mosaic, the first popular browser, which made it simple to download graphics and photos, audio and video files, and text.      Nerve center of Internet      The Internet\u2019s 13 root name servers of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) are like telephone books for the Internet: They translate Domain Name System addresses into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Without them, you would not be able to navigate from system to system.    Over the years many organizations have overseen domain names, IP address space, and protocol identification. In October 1998, the U.S. government contracted with ICANN to provide additional resources by overseeing its management. Its goal was to help private industry coordinate the assignment of duplicate IP addresses and domain names caused by the Internet\u2019s explosive growth. ICANN expanded its oversight as the telecommunications industry expanded.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

The internet grew out of earlier communication technologies, including radio, telephone, and television. The early ideas of computer networking were developed in the 1950s and 1960s. A plan for a new computer network called ARPANET was developed in 1966. ARPANET connected four computers at universities in California and Utah in 1969. By the early 1970s, ARPANET connected many computers, and many universities and research organizations had begun to study new ways of networking computers. In 1973, ARPANET became the first network to connect computers using different kinds of computers known as a \\\"packet-switched network\\\". During the 1980s, ARPANET was replaced by newer networks based on the same principles, and the number of these networks increased greatly. The online community became more than a group of researchers and technology enthusiasts. More people began to use computers and new online servers were developed for email and news.     The World Wide Web is one of many services that use the internet to connect computers, and it has made the internet popular around the world. The World Wide Web began in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal for a way of linking information on different computers. In 1991, you could start using it to look at text, images, and sounds on different pages connected by links. The World Wide Web is one of many services that use the internet.

Avoid links that look suspicious     Email spam (like junk mail) may have links that look real but really lead to fake sites. These fake sites may try to get your personal information (like password, bank account, or social security numbers). Emails from people you do not know and emails asking for money or other favors are often spam.     Before you click a link in an email or on a website:      - Read the description carefully to see what you are clicking.  - Hover your mouse pointer over the link to check where it goes (look in the lower left corner of your screen).    - Check the spelling of the link to make sure it is correct.  - Avoid using links in messages from senders you do not know.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Get more from your searches\\n                    Typed a question in the search box?

It began connecting computers at scientific and academic institutions around the country in 1969. The first four computers connected to the network were in it Stanford Research Institute, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. There are many protocols, or standards, that allow computers to communicate over networks. The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the primary communications protocol used for transmitting data over the Internet. TCP/IP was developed by computer scientists to connect dissimilar computers across networks. Two of its most important tasks are to ensure that data is sent and received reliably, and to provide addressing information so the data can be routed to the correct destination.\\n\\nThe Internet is made up of millions of smaller networks, which may be business, academic, and government networks, or personal networks of home computer users. These smaller networks are connected by telephone lines, cables, and satellites. When users connect to the Internet, they usually connect to an Internet service provider (ISP). Users may connect through an ISP at their local telephone exchange, or directly connect to the Internet through a network at an organization, such as a school or library. When a user links to a website or retrieves a web page, the computer sends a request across the Internet to the appropriate server. The server, which is a computer that stores a website or web page, sends the requested page back across the Internet to the user\u2019s computer. The page is then displayed by the user\u2019s web browser.

In the late 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense financed research into networking computers together. A team led by Dr. Robert Kahn and Dr. Vinton Cerf created a set of rules, called protocols, that would allow different kinds of computers on many networks to exchange information. One protocol, called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or TCP/IP, would become the standard for all networks. The project came to be known as ARPANET. In 1983, ARPANET adopted TCP/IP and became the first major part of the internet.    In 1971, an American computer engineer named Ray Tomlinson made the first networked email program. In it, Tomlinson used the @ sign with a username and computer name to form the first email address. Email became popular quickly and made the network more useful.    In the early 1980s, the National Science Foundation created a new technology called NSFNET, for research and education. It created the first internet \\\"backbone\\\", and connected networks and universities around the United States. It also encouraged commercial companies to create their own networks and connect to the NSFNET.   In 1991, researchers invented a \\\"World Wide Web\\\" system to organize and link information on the internet. People could easily read documents using standard commands.      In 1993, the first graphical web browser called Mosaic was invented. A few months later, the first site that searched the internet, called JumpStation, was created. It took between 20-30 minutes to search just 25,000 sites.   By the mid-1990s, the internet became more commercial. The NSFNET had created a massive telecommunications system for the whole United States. In 1995, the National Science Foundation ended its involvement with the internet backbone. Over time, private companies in the U.S. and Europe built their own telecommunication systems.   In 1999, internet use began to boom, as more people than ever connected to the World Wide Web.
