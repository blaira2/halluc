Sleep disorders happen when there are problems with the quality, timing, and amount of sleep, as well as with the sleep-wake cycle. These disorders affect how a person feels while awake. Common symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and abnormal behaviors during sleep. Many sleep disorders are chronic conditions but can be successfully managed with behavioral and/or pharmacologic treatment. What are the symptoms of sleep disorders? Common symptoms include: \u2022 Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep  \u2022 Excessive daytime sleepiness even after a full night\u2019s sleep  \u2022 Falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as during a meeting or when driving  \u2022 Sweating or dry mouth during sleep  \u2022 Sleepwalking during the night  \u2022 Abnormal breathing or snoring during sleep  \u2022 Abnormal movements during sleep \u2022 Nightmares or frightening dreams  \u2022 Memory loss or dif\ufb01culty concentrating How do I know if I have a sleep disorder?

If you continue to have symptoms despite trying the behavioral interventions suggested above, or if you have symptoms indicating a more serious problem (for example, loud snoring and pauses in breathing during sleep), talk to your health care provider. Your provider may refer you to a specialist in sleep disorders, who can perform specialized testing to diagnose your condition and provide treatment.

Treatment will depend on the speci\ufb01c type of sleep disorder you have. Treatment for many sleep disorders include one or more of the following: \u2022 Behavioral therapy \u2022 Medications \u2022 Devices, such as a machine that supplies air pressure through a mask (continuous positive airway pressure) or an oral appliance for obstructive sleep apnea \u2022 Surgery If you are experiencing sleep problems, consider the following: \u2022 Start by practicing healthy sleep habits (see above). \u2022 Consult your health care provider if symptoms persist for more than two weeks. \u2022 Work with your health care provider to identify sleep disorders that may be affecting you, and follow your provider\u2019s recommendations. \u2022 Ensure that your provider is experienced in addressing sleep problems. \u2022 Undergoing a sleep study may be necessary to diagnose your condition and may include overnight monitoring at a sleep center (such as a polysomnogram) or at home (home sleep testing, for example, for breathing problems).\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

If you want to change your bedtime, move it in increments of 15 to 20 minutes each day until you reach your desired bedtime. Choose a bedtime when you naturally feel sleepy. Create a bedtime routine to help you wind down before bed. This might involve reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to soft music. Avoid light from television and phone or computer screens. Avoid naps during the day and limit naps to 30 minutes, or avoid them altogether. Get plenty of natural light during the day, especially in the morning. Make sure that your bedroom is quiet, dark, and comfortable. Avoid eating heavy meals 2 to 3 hours before bedtime. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening. Avoid using alcohol and tobacco. Avoid vigorous exercise late in the evening. Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep, but exercising right before bed can have the opposite effect for some people. Get regular strenuous exercise, but limit exercise to earlier in the day. Avoid reading or watching television in bed. Only use your bed for sleep or sex. If you feel sleepy during the day, limit naps to 15 to 30 minutes. Don\u2019t force yourself to go to sleep; wait until you feel relaxed and sleepy to get into bed. Don\u2019t stare at the clock, which can increase your stress about not sleeping. If you are not asleep within 20 minutes after going to bed, get up and leave your bedroom. Do something relaxing but not too stimulating such as reading or listening to music. Do not use your phone or computer. Go back to bed when you feel sleepy. If you don\u2019t fall asleep within 20 minutes, get up again. Some people keep a sleep diary to help them understand and improve their sleep patterns. Write down what time you went to bed; how long it takes you to fall asleep; how many times you woke up and for how long; any unusual occurrences, such as stress; use of medications, food, caffeine, or alcohol; naps; and exercise.

To determine how many pounds of carbon dioxide a vehicle produces, multiply the number of miles driven by eight mpg by 19.4 pounds of carbon dioxide, then divide by the average mpg for the vehicle. For example, if a vehicle was driven 5,000 miles and gets 20 miles per gallon, multiply 5,000 times 8 times 19.4, then divide by 20 to get 38,800 pounds of carbon dioxide produced for the vehicle over the distance driven. 2.  To \ufb01nd a vehicle\u2019s average fuel economy, multiply 0.254 by the wheel diameter raised to the 0.75 power, multiply the result times the gear ratio raised to the 1.28 power, multiply that result by the rear axle ratio, then divide the result by the vehicle\u2019s horsepower. The wheel diameter is found by multiplying the tire width in inches by the aspect ratio as a percentage, then dividing by 1270 and adding the tire\u2019s rim diameter in inches. Alternate method: Go to www.fuelconomy.gov and enter your car\u2019s year, make, and model for fuel economy information about your vehicle. 4. Convert from kilograms or metric tons to pounds: 1 kilogram = 2.204 pounds 1 metric ton = 2,205 pounds 5. Multiply pounds of CO2 by 0.000454 to convert back to metric tons. How can I reduce the carbon footprint of my car? \u2022 Drive less. Take public transit, share rides, bike, walk, or telecommute. (Learn more in the \u201cTransit and ridesharing\u201d section.) \u2022 Buy the most fuel-ef\ufb01cient vehicle you can afford, and one that meets your needs. \u2022 Consider hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or electric vehicles. (Check the \u201cHybrid cars\u201d and \u201cEmerging vehicle technologies\u201d sections.) \u2022 Ensure your tires are properly in\ufb02ated; low tire pressure increases fuel consumption by 0.3 percent for each pound per square inch (psi) drop in the average pressure of all tires.

Some can be difficult because our society is based on carbon-intensive energy. Yet everyone can make meaningful changes, and when many people join in, it adds up to a large collective impact. Even if you can\u2019t change some things, you can still make a difference by improving what you can. Here is a quick overview of major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and how you can help reduce them: \u2022 Transportation: Use public transport whenever you can. If you regularly commute by car, combine errands or drop-offs and pickups to reduce the number of car trips you take. Walking and biking are good low-carbon options. Carpooling to work is helpful, and when you can, telecommute. For longer trips, steer toward high-speed rail over airplanes. If you \ufb02y, choose one nonstop \ufb02ight over a similar 2-leg \ufb02ight defined by a less-ef\ufb01cient transfer \u2013 avoid stopovers. Even one-stop trips nearly double your trip\u2019s carbon footprint. \u2022 Building and home energy use: In homes and commercial buildings combined, greenhouse gas emissions come primarily from heating and cooling (with ventilations systems and appliances to a smaller extent) and secondarily from using electricity for lighting. Cooking and water heating are secondary sources as well. Heating, cooling, and ventilating use fuels and electricity and are the largest direct source of household emissions. Reduce your energy use by sealing and insulating your home well, switching to ef\ufb01cient electric heating and cooling, improving lighting ef\ufb01ciency, limiting hot water use, and so on. \u2022 Food: Worldwide, food production is responsible for about 26 percent of all greenhousegas emissions based on the full life cycle including growing, harvesting, packaging, transport, consumption, and waste. One of the bigger and easier to address culprits is meat and dairy, especially beef. Both have a high water footprint as well, in part because they represent a source of \u201cembedded water.\u201d Emissions for beef and dairy are especially high, due to methane from cows\u2019 digestive systems and stored manure. Raising animals for food consumes large amounts of land and water and often bears down on biodiversity. Eating a more plant-based diet can reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than any other change you can make. Some vegetables and fruits also have high water footprints, including growth farther from market and reliance on hothouses or airfreight. The more local and seasonal your produce, the smaller its carbon footprint. \u2022 Goods: In the United States in 2016, about 19 percent of greenhouse gas emissions were attributed to goods production. The manufacturing of goods involves the consumption of energy directly and indirectly (on-site and off-site), and carbon emissions are proportional to the energy used. Shift to products using less energy at each stage of their lifecycle. Once you choose to hold onto a product, you reduce demand for new product cycles, which consume energy. Damaging products\u2013frequently replacing electronics or computers, for example\u2013also drives up emissions. Recycling sometimes can reduce the carbon footprint, compared to using raw materials. But for many materials, recycling is a very small part of the overall product footprint. \u2022 Waste and recycling: When food and other organic material (bio-waste) is sent to landfill, it generates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Europe, Japan, and many U.S. States are redirecting organic waste from land\ufb01lls to anaerobic digesters. And methane capture at land\ufb01lls is increasingly designed to generate power. Compost your food and other bio-waste and use it for gardening. It\u2019s nutrient-rich and reduces the need for carbon-intensive fertilizer. \u2022 Electricity: in California and much of the world, and at least on an annual basis year-round, hydro and nuclear and wind and solar produce about 50 percent of the world\u2019s electricity. It\u2019s important to note, however, that wind power actually generates more than its share over time as it doesn\u2019t slow down during periods of low electricity demand. Hydroelectric dams also produce electricity with no emissions for long periods, but their contribution is increasingly limited by altered river ecosystems as well as drought and competing potable water demands. The expanded use of non-dispatched and intermittent renewable resources such as solar and wind is further enabled by improvements in advancing the integration of these energy sources and the ability to better balance the grid and on the demand side. For areas where electricity generators are still predominantly carbon- emitting, clean your power by urging utilities to shift to carbon-free resources and investing in clean power yourself. What is my personal carbon footprint? A 2017 study from the University of California, Berkeley quanti\ufb01es the per capita carbon footprint of an average global citizen at 4 tons (metric tonnes) of carbon dioxide per year.

Ask if the animal is spayed or neutered and if it is microchipped for identi\ufb01cation purposes. Arrange for a veterinary checkup soon after adoption.

Once you have decided to adopt a pet, choose the type of pet that is best for you\u2014dog, cat, rabbit, or some other kind of animal. 2.  Choose a breed appropriate for your lifestyle, the space you have for the pet, and the amount of exercise and care you can provide. Dogs, for example, need more exercise than other kinds of pets. Choosing Where to Look for a Pet 1. Pet adoption is available at most area animal shelters. Contact the shelter in your county or city and visit the shelter to see the wide variety of animals available. 2. Many communities support pet adoption facilities in old pet stores. Check your local listings and visit these locations. 3. There are many private, nonprofit pet adoption organizations. Contact the Better Business Bureau or animal control organization for referrals. 4. Some nonprofit animal adoption organizations specialize in particular types of pets. Contact a local specialty veterinarian for referrals. Interviewing a Pet 1. Familiarize yourself with the breed characteristics of the animal you want and the temperament of that breed. Your local breeder, animal shelter, or rescue group can help you learn about particular breeds. 2. Observe the pet\u2019s behavior before adopting it. 3. If you are unsure of what pet to adopt or what breed of animal to choose, consult with a veterinarian or the shelter\u2019s adoption counselor. Cost of Adopting a Pet 1.

The fee may be partially covered if the animal has been spayed or neutered, has had age- appropriate vaccinations, and is microchipped, but there may be additional charges for any services not yet performed. \u2022 Ask about the animal\u2019s medical history and any behavioral history 05  before adoption.  \u2022 Test the animal\u2019s behavior. See if it reacts calmly and unpredictably with children and adults. Do the best you can\u2014you will not have long to observe the animal in the shelter environment.  \u2022 Check that the shelter adopts pets in compliance with all local ordinances. For example, if the local law requires that Pit Bulls must be restrained by a leash no more than six feet long and muzzled in public, the shelter must tell you about these requirements at the time of adoption. Cost of care . Be sure you are \ufb01nancially prepared to pay for the animal\u2019s care, which may include lifetime costs for food, grooming, training, and medical care. Many local humane societies or shelters will provide information on the costs of these items. Spaying or neutering . State law requires that all animals adopted from public or private shelters be spayed or neutered before being adopted. However, if there is a medical need to postpone the surgery, with proper documentation the shelter may issue a temporary permit of less than 30 days that allows the animal to be adopted without having been spayed or neutered. Criminal penalties are imposed for adopting out a companion animal that has not been spayed or neutered or for violating the terms of a temporary permit. Vaccinating . A local public animal control agency must ensure that its own shelter or any private shelter operator in its jurisdiction has current age- appropriate vaccinations for all dogs and cats before adoption. (Food & Agric. Code, \u00a7 31752.) Microchipping . As of July 1, 2024, all pet dogs adopted from California animal shelters must be \ufb01tted with and implanted with a microchip transponder before they are delivered to new owners. The microchip must be registered to the dog\u2019s new owner on a United States pet recovery data base or another alternative program approved by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The shelter must also provide the new owner with instructions on using the microchip to identify the dog. The adoption fee can include the cost of the microchip. (Food & Agric. Code, \u00a7 31771.) Secondary liability for damage caused by adopted animal. Someone who adopts an animal from a public or private animal shelter or pounds may be held responsible in a lawsuit for personal injuries or property damage caused by the animal within 10 days after the animal was legally adopted if: (a) the injuries were inflicted on a minor child (someone under 18), (b) the animal was a dog, (c) the injuries were caused by the dog biting, and (d) the plaintiff demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that within the 10 days the injured person or someone on his or her behalf noti\ufb01ed the adopter that the animal had caused the injury.

Sometimes stepping away from a problem or project refreshes your mind and allows new ideas to bubble up. Engage in a different activity, take a nap, or get some exercise. 5. Set up constraints . Sometimes limiting your options sparks creativity by forcing you to think around the barriers and come up with innovative solutions. 6. Collaborate . Sharing ideas with others and getting different perspectives can open up new avenues of thought. 7. Learn continuously . Expose yourself to a variety of knowledge and experiences. Read widely, travel, talk to people who think differently than you. This broadens your base of raw material for creative insight. 8. Reflect . Regularly reflect on your experiences and ideas.

List your monthly income from every source, including your wages, Social Security bene\ufb01ts, interest, dividends, and so on. \u2022 List all your expenses. Write down all your monthly expenses, including housing costs such as rent or a mortgage, utilities, food, debts, transportation, insurance, taxes, and health care. Be sure to include irregular or occasional expenses\u2014such as insurance premiums that are due quarterly or annually rather than monthly\u2014in your list as well. An easy way to calculate these is to \ufb01gure out what you spend each month on average by totals for the entire year and dividing by 12. For example, if you pay $600 for your car insurance every 6 months, divide $600 by 12 to get $50. $50 is what you spend on average per month on your car insurance. \u2022 Subtract your total expenses from your total income to see if you are overspending. It\u2019s best to have money left over after paying your expenses. You may want to put extra money in your savings to get ready for emergencies or big purchases. If you are regularly overspending, you may need to look for ways to reduce your expenses.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"If you cannot agree on a budget, the court may help you decide what amount is reasonable.

A budget helps you plan how to spend or save money so you don\u2019t run out of money before your next paycheck. It also helps you plan to pay your monthly expenses, repay any debts, and build savings. How do I create a budget? Step 1: For each source of income for your household (income from your job, your spouse\u2019s job, child support, pension, Social Security, and so on) write down how much money you receive each month. Step 2: Write down your monthly expenses. You can start by tracking the following for a few months and then add the information to your budget: \u2022 Bills (rent or mortgage payment, utilities, credit card minimum payments, and so on) \u2022 Other spending (groceries, money spent to get yourself or children to work or school, clothing, gas for your car, entertainment, and so on) Step 3: Add up your total monthly income. Step 4: Add up your monthly expenses. Step 5: Compare your total income to your monthly expenses. If income exceeds expenses, you\u2019re doing well. If your expenses exceed income, you should identify spending you can cut and increase your income. For example, cut back on eating out or limit shopping to essentials.

Try to keep enough cash in checking and savings accounts to cover at least one month of expenses. You should also keep enough cash on hand for a few days or weeks of expenses in case of an emergency. Avoid relying on credit cards as a substitute for budgeting. Using a credit card is borrowing money, so you might lose track of how much you actually have in your accounts. Do not rely on credit cards or other types of credit (such as a home equity line of credit) to meet recurring living expenses. What should I do? Periodically evaluate your current income and expenses to determine if you need to adjust your income or expenses in the near future. (For example, Research changes in employment income.

Budgets help you keep track of your income and determine how much you can spend in each category of expenses, such as housing, transportation, and food. How can I create a budget? There isn\u2019t one formula for budgeting that works for everyone, but the steps below may be helpful. 1. Learn how much you bring in. Calculate your total monthly income. For some people, income comes in as paychecks. For others, \ufb01nances must be planned for based on money coming in at irregular intervals, such as a periodic check from a trust or rent payments on a property you own. 2. Get organized. Choose one or two ways to keep track of your budget. Some people like to use a spreadsheet or budgeting app or software program (www.consumer.gov/budgeting). Others prefer to use a paper ledger, worksheets, or a pencil and notebook. Find a system that you\u2019ll use regularly, and stick to it. 3. Know your monthly expenses. List your recurring monthly expenses and average the irregular expenses. Know which bills are due each month and when. Common budget categories are listed below in number 5. 4. Track your purchases and spending categories. Once you have your expenses lined up against your income, track your spending. This step shows where you\u2019re spending \u2014 and where you might want to cut back. Keep your receipts. Review them each week, and move the amounts from your receipts to your budgeting system. Doing this throughout the month will track your spending and prepare you to make spending decisions in the last week of the month after you have factored in all of your income and expenses. 5. Compare your income and expenses over time and decide where you can cut back to save. Use the categories that best suit your situation: Basic Expenses: Housing: Rent or mortgage, property taxes, insurance, upkeep, utilities Transportation: Repairs, gas, insurance, account payments, public transportation Food, personal care items Medical and dental care Child support/alimony Recreation expenses Other loan payments, account fees Clothing Entertainment/bars/pubs Savings/retirement gifts/presents Gym membership Charitable contributions Disposable income Time to plan ahead for large purchases, trips, or expenses that don\u2019t occur monthly\u2014such as insurance premiums, vehicle registration, and holidays.

Challenges at every level: \ufb01rst move to checkmate There are 20\u00a0legal opening moves at the start of a game of chess. From that point, there are over 400\u00a0possible new positions! In fact, there are more potential chess games than there are known atoms in the universe! No wonder chess has such lasting appeal. You don\u2019t have to be a champion to get better. Nor should you wait until you gain experience. Follow these guidelines to become a stronger player and enjoy the game even more. #1 Learn the correct piece movements and basic rules. It\u2019s important to know these before you invest in more advanced skill-building. #2 Study the basic checkmating patterns. Practice each of these patterns until you can quickly spot them on the board. Create a pattern bank. The more of these you learn, the more possibilities you will be able to visualize and exploit during the game. #3 Learn basic opening principles. Chess openings have been studied for centuries. Each move leads to new possibilities. While it is impossible to study each one, chess players have identi\ufb01ed some general guidelines that result in good positions. By learning and practicing these, you will improve your game. #4 Practice but don\u2019t memorize openings. It is good to become familiar with common chess openings so you can get through the \ufb01rst moves quickly and easily. But problem-solving ability is much more important than rote memorization. The ability to analyze a position and imagine possible outcomes will become even stronger the more you play chess. #5 Use your time. Don\u2019t rush your play unless you\u2019re in a time scramble.

As you continue to play, you will gain and apply greater knowledge and experience and become more skilled. #7 Incidental learning. Over time, your experience will teach you. As you study openings, combinations, endgames, attacks, and defences, you\u2019ll apply that knowledge in games. Along the way, you\u2019ll likely gain insights by reading chess books or playing with advanced players. Even watching professional players on television, or analyzing their games, will contribute to your mastery of the game. #8 Study games of grandmasters. There are thousands of books and databases that include grandmaster chess games. By reviewing these, you can learn important strategies, openings, and combinations. #9 Analyze your games to identify strengths and weaknesses. You can spot the problems that cost you the most points\u2014and become a better player\u2014much faster by reviewing your games. #10 Relax, but stay attentive and positive. Openings and checkmating patterns can become obstacles if you concentrate too hard and lose sight of the game. Chess is a game but can feel very intense. Control any negative emotions and keep your focus during the game. Mark Dvoretsky, one of the world\u2019s leading teachers of chess, described one encounter in which he and a student played a game.

Preparation is also important. Before you give a speech, organize your thoughts and know your topic well. Anticipate questions your audience may have and practice answering them.

Some people \ufb01nd it helpful to practice in front of a mirror or video camera. Others practice in front of friends or family who will give them honest feedback. \u2022 Try to put nervous energy to good use by turning it into energy for your presentation. \u2022 Think about the very positive reaction you expect from the audience instead of worrying about what might go wrong. \u2022 Realize that a certain amount of nervousness is normal and that the audience probably won\u2019t notice it. \u2022 Try to get to know some of the audience members before giving a presentation. This will make the audience seem less intimidating. \u2022 Breathe deeply and slowly before speaking. \u2022 Dress comfortably but appropriately. \u2022 Have a glass of water on hand. Speaking for a long period of time can dry your mouth and throat. Put a bottle of water away from sight so you can easily reach it without disrupting your speech. Consider the following additional tips:  \u2022 It\u2019s better to prepare too much than not enough. If you prepare too much, you can omit what you don\u2019t have time to say. \u2022 Write down your key points on note cards. Avoid using full sentences or paragraphs; it\u2019s too tempting to just read instead of speaking naturally. \u2022 When you begin your speech, look around the room and make eye contact with people in different parts of the audience. If that\u2019s too intimidating, look just above the heads of the audience. \u2022 If you lose your train of thought, stop and take several deep breaths until you feel calm. You can also ask the audience a question to give yourself time to collect your thoughts. \u2022 Try not to use \ufb01ller words such as \u201cum,\u201d \u201cah,\u201d and \u201cyou know.\u201d These are natural sounds people make, especially when nervous.

You will also gain the trust and respect of the jury, thereby making your closing argument more persuasive. To become a better public speaker, you should understand the barriers to effective communication, practice your presentation, and develop an effective speaking style. Barriers to Effective Communication Dif\ufb01culties in communication arise everyday, and they can be exacerbated in a trial setting by tension, time constraints, and various courtroom interruptions. To be as effective as possible, a trial lawyer should recognize the existence of common barriers and work to overcome them. Three of the most common barriers to effective communication are: (1) hearing and listening; (2) cultural and language differences; and (3) distractions. Hears vs. Listens When most people attend trials, they are under stress and may try to listen more carefully. However, most people can speak at a rate of about 150 words per minute but can hear at a rate of 400 words per minute. This difference encourages many speakers to talk faster than the listener can comprehend. On the other hand, many speakers slow down their rate of speech to allow their audience suf\ufb01cient time to process what is being said. However, they go to the opposite extreme; the speech becomes so slow that the audience loses interest. The best strategy is to speak at a somewhat slower rate than normal conversation but with enough pitch, volume, and change of pace to keep the audience interested and awake. Cultural and Language Differences In almost any trial, speaker and listener can differ by age, gender, economic and social background, regional origin, ethnicity, and life experiences. In cross- examination in particular, cultural and linguistic differences between lawyers and witnesses may cause communication breakdowns. When cross-examining witnesses who are not members of the dominant culture in the courtroom, lawyers should avoid incorporating their own cultural biases into their questioning and presentation. They should attempt to understand how the witness\u2019s cultural background affects the witness\u2019s communication. They should avoid using language that is unfamiliar or that restrains \u00bf 644 \u00bf the witness. They should avoid expressions whose meaning they do not understand and should avoid idioms and colloquialisms, which may not be understood by a witness from another culture. Distractions Distractions, such as attorneys arguing outside the presence of the jury, sidebar conferences, noise in the courtroom, or interruptions by \ufb01lling jurors in on what has happened in the trial, exacerbate communication problems. These types of distractions should be minimized as much as possible. Practicing Your Presentation It is often during the practice of their presentations that trial lawyers learn the most about how to improve the delivery of their closing argument. The act of trying out the closing argument will help you understand the appropriate tone, pace, and volume to use; become aware of distracting mannerisms; and increase your con\ufb01dence. Practicing the actual delivery in the courtroom, if feasible, can be very valuable for getting comfortable in that setting. One effective exercise is to \ufb01lm yourself delivering your presentation. Watching the video will help you determine whether you should emphasize or downplay certain points, should speak more slowly or more quickly, whether your style is natural and appropriate, and whether you should improve your gestures and body language. It is almost certain that you will notice things you should have done differently from what you expected you would do. Body Language Body language is an important aspect of \u201cstyle.\u201d Your manner of speaking contributes to your style, but it is your body language and nonverbal cues that give your presentation personality and humanity. Body language can express con\ufb01dence or insecurity, dominance or submission, honesty or deceit. Lawyers should use their bodies, as well as their words, to communicate with jurors, to reinforce or enhance their verbal message. Effective delivery requires movement and a positive use of space, as well as awareness of posture, facial expression, and eye contact. Movement Movement is a very effective way of regaining a jury\u2019s attention and making a transition from one theme to another. Movement can also reinforce the emotional content of a statement. If you are moving when you speak, it is less likely that you will speak in a monotone. Transitions have a better impact when accompanied by deliberate, soft, slow movements, for example when stepping back from the jury box, then slowly walking across the courtroom. Movements and gestures reinforce or emphasize verbal messages. You could say \u201cI\u2019m going to make three points\u201d and display three \ufb01ngers, or say \u201cI\u2019m a little nervous\u201d and tap your toe. Aggressive gestures will intimidate or alienate jurors, while restrained, soft gestures express sincerity and surety. Hand gestures can be a useful tool for emphasizing speci\ufb01c points, provided that the gestures are natural and not arti\ufb01cial or forced. Spontaneous, natural hand gestures increase the speaker\u2019s credibility. Forced or overly dramatic hand gestures tend to\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Public speaking is one of the most common fears that people have.

The better you know your material and the more often you practice, the more con\ufb01dent\u2014 and less nervous\u2014you will be when speaking publicly. Know your audience.

Make eye contact with your audience. Looking at your notes or the \ufb02oor make you appear insincere. Use your voice to emphasize important points.

Nonetheless, it can be successfully overcome with practice. Preparation and practice are the keys to successful public speaking. Start by organizing your thoughts and creating an outline of your presentation. Practice delivering your speech in front of a mirror or record yourself to improve your delivery. Then, try to speak in front of close friends or family members who can provide positive feedback and gentle constructive criticism. Gradually increase the size of the audience where you practice. Develop effective breathing and relaxation techniques to help manage nervousness. Maintain a positive attitude and visualize your success before and during your presentation. Be aware of your body language, gestures, and facial expressions. Use them to enhance your message and keep the audience engaged. What can I do if I am nervous? Put your nervousness to good use. Use the energy from your nervousness to enhance your enthusiasm and passion for your topic. Engage your audience with your excitement and make sure they know you care about the topic. Do not pretend to be confident if you are not. If you are afraid to admit to yourself that you feel nervous, you will not be able to manage your nervousness. Recognize your fear and acknowledge your nervousness so you can focus on overcoming it. Do not try to be all things to all people. Concentrate on the needs of your audience. Speak to them as individuals\u2014do not treat them as a group. Your illusory audience will not be betrayed by your insincerity. Do not apologize for being nervous. Your audience does not want, or expect, you to be perfect. Accept that you are not perfect and that you will make some mistakes. Your audience will appreciate your honesty and your humanity. It will help you relax and speak more freely and naturally. How can I avoid looking at my notes too much? Look at your notes as needed, but do not look at them so much that you never make eye contact with your audience. Practice your speech so often and so thoroughly that you become very familiar with your material. When you become very familiar with your material, you will be able to speak more freely, which will make you seem and feel more natural. Should I use visual aids? Visual aids can increase the audience\u2019s understanding and retention of your message. They add impact, interest use an appropriate number for the length of your presentation. Do not use visual aids simply to increase the number of things you have 8\u20139 wants to talk about. Use visual aids only when they enhance comprehension and serve a meaningful purpose. Make sure your visual aids are clear, accurate, and easy to see. Do not rely on your visual aids to carry your presentation. You should have the \ufb01nal responsibility for the presentation. What else should I know? The pronunciation of a word is very important when delivering a presentation. You may often hear words pronounced incorrectly. Look up any words you are unsure of in a dictionary to make sure you are pronouncing them correctly. Read your speech aloud to catch any additional errors. Often, you will \ufb01nd that some vocabulary or sentence structures do not quite sound right when read aloud. Practice your speech after you have made any necessary corrections.

Tuning is very important, because a poorly tuned guitar means that you will not sound good, even if you are playing the right notes and chords. Your guitar may already have a built-in tuner, but there are also stand-alone and combination tuners available at music stores. There are even several tuning apps available for smartphones and tablet computers. Ask a guitar teacher or sales associate at a music store to show you how to use a tuner. Most guitars can be tuned to the same notes and intervals in a number of different ways. But the most common pattern of tuning from the low E-string up to the high E-string is as follows: low E, A, D, G, B, high E (the strings are labeled by their pitch name). Continuously tuning your guitar will not damage the instrument. The only time when it is necessary to retune less frequently is if your guitar has just been tuned to a higher pitch. When you tune each string to a note that is lower than it currently is, this can usually be done without affecting the neck or strings. But if you tune the strings higher than they currently are, and then tune them higher yet, this is \u201cputting a strain\u201d on the guitar. In most cases, your guitar\u2019s neck will settle back down, allowing you to tune as often as you need to. However, if you increase the tension too much, you can damage the neck and strings.

There are three main types of guitars: acoustic, resonator, and electric. Acoustic guitars are the most common. These guitars come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Each body shape produces its own distinctive sound. The popular dreadnought shape, for example, produces a stronger bass tone and a richer overall sound than the more traditional \u201chourglass\u201d shape. Smaller, acoustic-bodied guitars with a shorter scale length, called parlor guitars or travel guitars, also are popular. Acoustic guitars are played by strumming or picking the strings with the \ufb01ngers or a pick. Some guitars have built-in ampli\ufb01ers so the instrument can be played both acoustically and electrically. Resonator guitars look something like acoustic guitars but have a metal cone in place of the traditional sound hole. The cone acts as a speaker, amplifying the sound of the guitar. Resonator guitars are most common in jazz and bluegrass music. The strings are sometimes strummed with a heavy pick in the traditional manner. These guitars also can be played by sliding a steel or glass bar over the strings, rather than pressing them against the fretboard. This is called slide guitar or bottleneck guitar. Electric guitars produce sound electronically. They are usually equipped with pickups\u2014device that pick up string vibrations and transfer them to a sound ampli\ufb01er. A highly in\ufb02uential guitar sound came from the electric sound of the blues guitarist T-Bone Walker in the 1940s. The sound is sustained and has a vocal quality created by amplifying the guitar signal and using a tremolo arm. The electric guitar has had a major impact on popular music since the 1950s. The early 1960s saw the \ufb02ourishing of folk guitarists such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan and, later, Joni Mitchell. Some electric guitarists in the 1960s focused on distortions of the amplified instrument, giving rise to hard rock and heavy metal. Among these guitarists were Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Carlos Santana, David Gilmour, and Steve Howe.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"If you are interested in learning to play the guitar, you may want to start by taking lessons.

After that, you\u2019ll be ready to learn some basic chords and activities that will help you hit just the right notes. Learn the names of the strings. From the lowest string (closest to you) to the highest, the string notes are called (1) E, (2) A, (3) D, (4) G, (5) B, and (6) e. As standard tuning, strings 1 and 6 play the note E. The 6th string is the thickest string on the guitar, and the 1st string is the thinnest. This makes it easy to identify the strings by feel. You don\u2019t need to know the names of the strings to play chords, but knowing the names of the strings is an important step in learning how to read music notation for guitar. You just need to know where to place your \ufb01ngers on the fretboard to play certain notes and chords. Learn how to tune your guitar. You can use a guitar tuner to get your guitar in the right key. You can also buy apps  or watch videos online that will help you learn to tune a guitar. If you learn to tune your guitar by ear, try turning on a radio, playing along, and then listen and adjust your tuning until your guitar sounds perfect along with the song. It\u2019s not too dif\ufb01cult to learn how to tune your guitar reading audio notes with a tuner or by listening to recordings and reproducing those sounds. If you have a piano or keyboard, you can use that as a tuning guide, too. Learn your \ufb01rst chords. You can take lessons, watch how to play guitar videos online , or use guitar chord apps that provide interactive help. The most popular beginner chords are A, Am, C, D, Dm, E, Em, and G, and these are the chords in the table below. Learn how to hold your \ufb01ngers and press the strings down on the right fret. Don\u2019t hold the strings down too hard or you\u2019ll hurt your \ufb01ngers. Don\u2019t hold them down too lightly or the strings will buzz. A sensation like a splinter or a little sting is normal but shouldn\u2019t be painful. It usually takes about two weeks before the tips of your left index, middle, and ring \ufb01ngers grow callused enough so that playing the guitar doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. Learn to strum the guitar. Strum the strings over the soundhole to play chords, and strum the strings using small patterns (up\u2013down\u2013up\u2013down, for example) to create rhythm. You can use the side of your index \ufb01nger or a guitar pick (also called a plectrum ) to strum the strings. A pick is a small triangular or teardrop-shaped piece of plastic. You hold the pick between your thumb and index \ufb01nger so that it juts out a little. Then strum the strings with the pick, angling it slightly across the strings. A pick creates a sharper, brighter sound than your \ufb01ngers do. Make your guitar sound good. When you have your guitar tuned in standard tuning and playing correctly, your guitar will sound good. You can make your guitar sound better by tweaking (\ufb01ne-tuning) your guitar\u2019s settings or adjusting your posture. It helps to play your guitar as loudly as possible without distorting the sound or hurting the audience\u2019s ears. Tips for beginners. If you have too small a guitar, it hurts your hands. Make sure your guitar is the right size for your height and hand size. Beginners usually don\u2019t play a guitar with the best playability, but you should buy an instrument that you can afford that\u2019s also comfortable to play. Like a good sports car, an expensive guitar that\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to play isn\u2019t any more fun than a cheap car that\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to drive.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Learning to play the guitar involves understanding both the physical mechanics of the instrument and the theoretical elements of music.

It requires patience and practice, but with guidance, anyone can succeed. This recipe is for sourdough bread, which is made by naturally cultivating wild yeast and bacteria in a mixture of \ufb02our and water. The cultivated yeast gives more rise to the dough and further develops the taste of the bread. Once you\u2019ve created your starter, it will live in your kitchen forever, giving you endless loaves of delicious bread. You just need to remember to feed your starter every day. The starter needs three ingredients: \ufb02our, water, and time. It takes around seven days to get a good starter going. Flour needs water to activate the yeast and bacteria so they can begin metabolizing and fermenting in the process of raising your dough. The longer the fermentation process the sourdough bread undergoes, the more complex its \ufb02avor will be as the yeast continues to metabolize in the bread. A true sourdough starter requires virtually no other additions than \ufb02our and water. It\u2019s natural! Flour\u2014not commercially produced\u2014is the only element you add that includes yeast. Yeast is a living organism. Stored in flour and water, living yeast grows by natural fermentation. It metabolizes sugars in flour and water, causing the dough to rise over time. This produces both carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. The gas causes dough to rise. The alcohol contributes to the rich taste and aroma. In your starter, bacteria ferment the sugars as well and produce acids, which add nicely to the sour \ufb02avor and help preserve the bread. For even bigger rises, the acidity triggers an enzyme in the wheat that breaks down the starch cells into sugars and keeps the crust from browning too quickly while baking. The bacterial species Lactobacillus produces metabolic by-products that lend the sourdough bread its characteristic sour tang and support the yeast\u2019s growth. In addition, the bacteria metabolize the gluten in flour for easier digestibility.

Making sourdough bread is a lengthy process that requires an initial preparation of the starter (separate instructions). To make the bread: Ingredients Sourdough starter 1 cup, active (feed 6\u20138 hours before using) Water, 80\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F (27\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C)\\n1 cup All-purpose \ufb02our 3 to 3\u00bc cups Toasted wheat or rye berries, lightly ground to a weak \ufb02our 2 tablespoons Salt 1 tablespoon Cooking oil, as needed (preferably canola or safflower oil) Equipment Large banneton basket (or a bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel and \ufb02oured) Baking stone (or inverted heavy-duty baking sheet) Dutch oven (optional) Slashing blade or serrated knife (optional) 1. In a mixing bowl, dissolve 1 cup of active starter in 1 cup water. Add 2 cups \ufb02our, toasted wheat \ufb02our, and salt, and mix well. 2. Gradually add enough additional \ufb02our to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough, a little stickier than most bread dough. Only add the wheat \ufb02our 1 tablespoon at a time, as too much will make the dough hard to handle. 3. Scrape the dough onto a clean surface and knead it for about 10 minutes, adding a few drops of oil if necessary to coat the dough. It should feel smooth and pliable but not sticky. 4. Return the dough to the mixing bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it ferment in a warm (78\u00b0F/26\u00b0C), draftfree location for 1\u00bd to 2 hours, or until doubled in size. 5. Gently deflate the dough, re-cover, and let it rise again for 1\u00bd to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in size. 6. Turn the dough onto a lightly \ufb02oured surface. Gently press and stretch the dough into a large round. Fold each edge into the middle, shape into a ball, then \ufb02ip the dough\u00a0over and place it, seam side down, into a large banneton basket dusted with rice \ufb02our. 7. Cover the basket with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 2 to 2\u00bd hours, or until nearly doubled in size. If you will be baking the bread at a later time, refrigerate the basket covered for up to 12 hours (see note). 8. About 1 hour before baking, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C), placing a baking stone on the lowest rack of the oven. 9. Turn baking dough onto a large piece of parchment paper. With a sharp knife or slashing blade, slash a shallow \u201cX\u201d 5 inches across and down the middle of the loaf, cutting about \u00bc inch into the dough. 10. Transfer the parchment paper and dough to the preheated stone. Pour 1 cup of boiling water into a pan on the lowest rack to create steam, then close the oven door immediately. 11. Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes. The loaf is done when the crust is brown and crispy. If you tap the bottom of the loaf, it will sound hollow. Remove the bread from the oven and place it directly on the rack to cool completely (at least 2 hours) before slicing. Remove bread from the banneton, cover with plastic, and refrigerate up to 24 hours. Let bread come to room temperature for 1 hour before eating. 12. Store the cooled bread, wrapped in a cotton kitchen towel, in a paper bag or breadbox at room temperature for up to 3 days. Freeze cooled bread, wrapped in foil and then in a heavy-duty freezer bag, up to 1 month. Defrost at room temperature again wrapped in foil. Variations \u2022 To make a whole-wheat sourdough, substitute \u2153 cup wholewheat \ufb02our for the all-purpose \ufb02our in step 1, then gradually add additional all-purpose \ufb02our as needed to make the dough follow the instructions, up to a total of 3\u00bc cups all-purpose \ufb02our. Then continue with the recipe as directed. \u2022 To make rye sourdough, substitute \u00bd cup coarsely ground rye for the wheat \ufb02\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Sourdough bread is made using a natural leavening process instead of commercial yeast. This process involves creating and cultivating a sourdough starter, which is a mixture of \ufb02our and water that captures wild yeast and bacteria from the environment. Here\u2019s a basic guide to making sourdough bread: 1. Create a Sourdough Starter 1 Day 1: Mix \u00bd cup all-purpose \ufb02our with \u00bd cup water in a clear container. Stir to combine, cover loosely with a cloth or plastic wrap, and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours. 2 Day 2: You might see a few bubbles at this point. Discard half of the starter, then feed it with \u00bd cup all-purpose \ufb02our and \u00bd cup water. Mix well and cover loosely. 3 Day 3-6: Repeat the feeding process each day. After several days, your starter will become bubbly, rise in volume, and develop a pleasant, slightly sour smell. This means it\u2019s ready to use for baking. 2. Make the Dough (Active Starter Required) Ingredients: \u2022 1 cup sourdough starter  \u2022 11\u20442 cups warm water  \u2022 43\u20444 cups all-purpose \ufb02our  \u2022 1 tablespoon sugar  \u2022 1 tablespoon salt  Instructions: 1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the 1 cup of active sourdough starter with 11\u20442 cups warm water, 31\u20442 cups of all-purpose \ufb02our, and sugar. Mix well to form a sticky dough. 2. Add the salt and gradually add the remaining fl our while kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic but still somewhat sticky. You may not need to use all the flour. 3. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Allow it to ferment at room temperature for 4 to 12 hours, or until it has doubled in size. 4. Gently remove the dough and place it on a lightly \ufb02oured surface. Shape it into a loaf and place it into a greased or parchment-lined loaf pan or onto a baking sheet. 5. Cover the dough again and allow it to rise for another 1 to 2 hours until puffy. 3. Bake the Bread 1. About 30 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). 2. Optional: Dust the loaf lightly with flour and use a sharp knife or razor blade to score (make shallow cuts in) the top of the bread. This allows gases to escape during baking and gives the bread a decorative appearance. 3. Place the bread in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). 4. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. 5. Cool the bread on a wire rack before slicing.

Most importantly, your ability to meditate will grow with your commitment and consistency. Start by making a small commitment\u2014spending \ufb01ve minutes a day meditating, for example. If \ufb01ve minutes feels too daunting at \ufb01rst, start with one minute. Do what feels comfortable, but try to be regular.

Prepare Your Own Questions  Prepare a list of thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer about the role and the company. This shows your interest and enthusiasm. 5.

Organize Your Materials  Bring multiple copies of your resume, a list of references, and any other documents that might be relevant, such as a portfolio. 7. Plan Your Journey  Ensure you know the interview location and plan your route in advance. Aim to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early. 8.

Make a list of your references. Bring at least three names (including addresses and phone numbers) of former supervisors or other professional contacts who can say positive things about your work. 6. Double-check the interview appointment time. Make sure you have the correct address, time, and contact person\u2019s telephone number. 7. Plan how you will get to the interview.

Follow these steps for a successful start. Where can I grow a vegetable garden? Choose a sunny location that has well-drained soil. Most vegetables need at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight daily. How big should my garden be? Start small, with a planting area of about 3 by 6 feet. This will give you plenty of fresh vegetables to feed your family for most of the summer. If you want a bigger garden, consider a raised bed for easier maintenance. What vegetables should I plant? Pick your favorite vegetables, or those you use most in cooking. Choose early, midseason, and late vegetable varieties to ensure a steady supply. How do I get my soil ready? Pull weeds and till the soil to a depth of about 12 inches. Mix in aged compost, which adds valuable nutrients and makes it easier to work the soil. After preparing the soil, form planting rows roughly 1 foot apart. When is the best time to plant? Plant when the danger of frost has passed, but check the seed packet for speci\ufb01c instructions. Some plants, such as lettuce, peas, and radishes, can be started in a garden earlier than others. Which vegetables do best in my area? Contact a local nursery to learn which vegetables grow best in your area. Some of the easiest young plants to grow include tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, beans, peppers, and lettuce. How often should I water? Most vegetables need 1 inch of water per week. Water deeply every few days rather than giving them a little bit daily. This encourages deeper root growth and makes plants more resistant to pests and diseases. How can I keep weeds out of my garden? During the growing season, pull weeds frequently before they mature. Applying mulch to the soil surface can also help reduce weeds.

Your local cooperative extension of\ufb01ce [ insert contact information ] can tell you which vegetables grow well in your area and when to plant. Then choose vegetables to grow that you and your family enjoy. Some vegetables\u2014such as peppers, eggplant, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli\u2014need a long growing season. Others, such as tomatoes, squash, green beans, corn, cucumbers, and carrots, have shorter cooking times and are usually easier to grow. What type of soil do I need? Most vegetable gardens do best in humus-rich soil that drains well and holds moisture. To protect against soil diseases, never grow the same type of vegetable in the same soil twice. Rotate crops every few years so plants such as tomatoes don\u2019t grow where potatoes previously did. If you have a backyard, dig in some organic material such as grass clippings, comfrey, or manure to improve the soil. Manure must be properly aged. Cutting a garden in a lawn destroys the grass and underground roots; grass seeds may sprout in your new vegetable garden. How much sun will my garden need? For best results, a vegetable garden should receive direct sunlight for at least six hours a day. You may want to use movable containers for vegetables such as tomatoes to catch the sun\u2019s rays. Some vegetables\u2014such as leafy lettuce, spinach, and broccoli\u2014tolerate more shade and can be planted where sunlight is less plentiful. How do I put together my garden? Make garden rows about the width of a garden hoe apart. Raised beds can make gardening more comfortable and add drainage to clay soils. You may want to lay a soilless material, such as wood chips or gravel, along the path between raised beds so that grass and weeds do not invade. Set up a makeshift row cover with wire hoops to protect tender crops. Row covers can be made from cheesecloth, frost cloth, or plastic. 492\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

You can grow many types of vegetables, even if you do not have a yard. You might grow many vegetables in containers on a balcony, porch, or windowsill. Once a suitable place is found, you can begin to plan your garden. Step 1: Select a site Most vegetables need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Find a place with good sunlight that is well drained and near a water source. Step 2: Prepare the soil Remove all plants and debris from the site. Till or turn the soil as deep as the spade will reach. If the soil does not stick together when squeezed, in\ufb02uence it by mixing in three to four inches of organic matter such as leaf mold, peat moss, or rotted manure. This helps nourish the plants and gives the soil better moisture and drainage. If adjustments are needed to the soil pH (acidity) or to add nutrients, add lime, bone meal, or other ingredients as recommended by a soil test. Step 3: Determine what kinds of vegetables to plant Step 4: Plant It is best to start with vegetable plants from nurseries or garden centers. Starting with healthy plants is easier and less likely to fail than starting with seeds. However, some vegetables, such as carrots and beans, do better from seed. Buying vegetable seeds takes a little extra planning, since you must know when to plant them.

During my initial two years of teaching in business schools I worked part time as a consultant. I have continued to do this through my entire academic career, following my passion rather than settling for a traditional nine-to-\ufb01ve job. My career has become a portfolio made up of multiple businesses with some redundancy in source of revenues and balanced over time.\u201d Many people want to work like this, and most do not want to jump right in without some preparation. There are two roads to the freelancing life. One is to make freelancing your main source of income. The other is to make it your side business while keeping a full- or part-time job. We refer to these two blended career patterns as \u201cdual\u201d and \u201ctransitioner\u201d approaches. Dual Career Structure. This approach involves working two jobs simultaneously: your traditional job and your freelance business. You alternate your time, your attention, and your priorities between the two jobs based on immediate needs and time schedules. Dual Track Transition. Using this approach, you stay in your regular job until your freelancing business generates enough revenue to become your sole source of income. Approximately 33 percent of professionals become freelancers this way. Just over one- half of freelancers start their businesses while working full time as regular employees. Either way, the dual career structure gives you time to create a client base through research and networking. It also allows you to learn and grow as a new businessperson without the anxiety of an immediate loss of income. If you are tired of working for others or fear losing your job\u2014and you have the time and energy\u2014this may be your best choice. Whatever your path\u2014dual or transitioner\u2014there are some tasks you should do right away to launch your freelancing career: 1. Research the market. Learn everything you can about current and future demand for your services. Talk to potential clients and observe what competitors are doing. Make sure there are enough opportunities to keep you in business. 2. Prepare a master business plan. Your freelancing activities will re\ufb02ect your goals, your skills, your available resources, and the opportunities you identify. It is important to get these ideas down on paper in a format you can review on a regular basis. 3. Review your time and dollars. Accurately estimate the time you can budget to freelancing, as well as how much you need to earn in that time. Accurately estimate your start-up costs and ongoing operating expenses. Consider your lifestyle and how much income you earn and need after taxes. 4. Build your active network. Identify as many professionals as you can (especially in your target market) who will serve as your allies and potential customers. Contacts can always be grown with personal visits or phone calls. 5. Gather reference material. Compile samples of your work. Collect published references and letters of recommendation. Note any professional service awards you\u2019ve received. 6. Secure your working papers. Obtain any licenses, permits, or certi\ufb01cations you will need in your freelance career. 7. Create system supports. Make arrangements for completing tasks that take time but do not directly create income: record keeping, invoicing, and collection. Consider hiring outside help. 8. Develop promotional materials. These include a professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or CV, and a brochure. Include price quotations for commonly requested services. 9. Retain professional advisors.

Think about why you want to become a freelancer and what you want to accomplish, both personally and \ufb01nancially. Your freelance work should not only put food on the table, but also bring you some enjoyment. 2. Determine Your Starting Rate  . When you\u2019re new, you may have to set your rates low to re\ufb02ect your inexperience. Many freelancers work for low wages in the beginning, and then gradually increase their rates as their skills and reputation grow. 3. Identify Your Prospects  .

Start slowly, do excellent work, and develop a reputation for being dependable. In freelancing, you are your own brand. 8. Improve Your Marketing Skills and Service Offerings  . To keep your freelancing business growing, you need to learn new skills and re\ufb01ne existing skills so you can improve your service offerings. At the same time, you need to regularly improve your selling methods and techniques. Freelancing is not just about providing excellent service; it\u2019s also about being able to sell yourself. 9. Manage Your Business Risks  . Developing a reputation and building a client base takes time. During the startup period, research what programs exist to help self-employed individuals. Find out if you qualify for unemployment insurance bene\ufb01ts in your state. Ask questions about the federal health insurance program for former military personnel. Establish a relationship with your local Small Business Development Center in case you need assistance in the future. Work with your local and state economic development agencies.

Build a base. Most training programs require you to have been running regularly for a few months before you begin the formal training. If you haven\u2019t been running regularly, spend some time building your \ufb01tness before you start marathon training. Jog slowly for at least 20 minutes, three times a week to build your base. 2. Increase mileage gradually. Most programs have you increase your weekly mileage slowly, so your body can adjust to the stress. Only increase your runs gradually: do no more than increase your total weekly mileage by 10% per week, and increase your longest weekly run distance by no more than one mile per week. 3. Run at an easy pace for long runs. Most training programs include one long run each week. These runs are usually done at a slow pace because they are designed to increase endurance (the ability of your muscles to run for a long period of time) and aerobic capacity (the ability of your heart and lungs to transport oxygen during exercise). 4. Train your body to burn fat. The body\u2019s main source of fuel during exercise is a combination of carbohydrates (from stored glycogen in muscles) and fats. Your body has a limited supply of glycogen, but an almost unlimited supply of fat. Running at a slow pace allows your body to tap into its fat stores for fuel. 5. Incorporate speed training. Most training programs also include a few days of speed training, such as tempo or interval runs. Speed training helps increase your lactate threshold: the point at which your muscles begin to fatigue from accumulating lactic acid. Increasing your lactate threshold improves your endurance at higher running speeds. 6. Taper. Most training programs include a tapering phase after your peak training period. During the taper, mileage is drastically reduced to allow your body to recover and to \u201cstore up\u201d energy. 7. Plan a recovery week. Every 3 to 6 weeks, your training program should include a week where you reduce mileage to allow recovery. 8. Listen to your body.

Part 1: The Beginning It\u2019s common for novels to start by introducing the main characters and describing their everyday life. Then something happens that changes the situation\u2014this is often called the inciting incident. For example, in the fairy tale of Cinderella, the inciting incident is when she receives the invitation to the royal ball. At the beginning of many stories, the main character has an impossible goal. This sets up the central con\ufb02ict in the story. In the tale of Cinderella, her goal is to go to the ball and meet the prince. Because of her circumstances, this seems impossible. By the end of the story, she will either succeed in achieving her goal or she\u2019ll have a new understanding that changes her goal. Part 2: The Middle Once the goal is set and the story is underway, the character faces additional obstacles, which create tension and suspense. These obstacles could be external problems, such as a villain or natural disaster, or they could be internal, such as fear or a moral dilemma. It\u2019s common for characters to fail at their goal multiple times, which keeps the story interesting. For example, Cinderella\u2019s stepsisters prevent her from going to the ball. (She even fails at attending the ball the \ufb01rst time.) Part 3: The End The story reaches its climax when the character faces a \ufb01nal decision or action that determines whether the goal is achieved or abandoned. It is the moment of greatest tension and excitement. Afterward, the story resolves the remaining issues and provides a sense of closure. In the fairy tale, the story climaxes when the prince tries the glass slipper on Cinderella\u2019s foot. (She succeeds at her goal.) Tips for Writing a Novel 1. Read a lot of novels! By reading, you\u2019ll get a better understanding of what makes a good story, whether it\u2019s through plot, characters, or dialogue. 2. Start with a compelling inciting incident. Something has to happen at the beginning to push the story forward. 3. Create realistic characters. Consider giving your characters \ufb02aws or fears that they need to overcome. (For example, in The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy  is homesick and wants to \ufb01nd her way back to Kansas.) 4. Add con\ufb02ict. Think of what obstacles your main characters will face and how they will overcome them, or not. 5. Begin by writing a rough draft. Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not perfect\u2014it will get better as you revise and rewrite. 6. Consider titling each chapter of your book.

Novels include many of the other forms of \ufb01ction that you\u2019ve written, just with much greater detail, and generally a more complicated plot and subplots. Novels are typically told in prose, though occasionally poetry or other creative devices are used in portions of a novel. Regardless of length, stories told primarily through dialogue are plays, not novels. You are not limited to a single narrator. You may tell a novel\u2019s story through the eyes of a single protagonist, multiple characters, or even an omnipresent narrator who doesn\u2019t appear in the plot. Nor are you limited to a single point of view. You can tell the entire story from a single character\u2019s viewpoint, or use multiple viewpoints that alternate in different chapters, different sections, or even different paragraphs. It\u2019s helpful to have a plan before writing your novel. This plan is often called an outline . The outline should describe, in a few sentences each, the major events of the story. The outline doesn\u2019t have to be set in stone; you can modify it as you write the novel. Some writers prefer to use a mostly or entirely improvisational approach to developing a novel. While it is possible to write a novel without a clear plan for what will happen, you will still work through the same basic elements needed to tell a compelling and cohesive story. You should also decide the structure for your novel before you start writing. Most novels are divided into chapters, but they are sometimes divided into smaller parts or larger sections as well. Many novels begin with an introductory passage called a prologue and conclude with a short section called an epilogue. Prologues and epilogues are a bit like framing devices: The prologue sets the stage for the main story, and the epilogue brings closure after the main story ends.

No matter how you choose to study, the most important key to success at tests is preparation. Here are some tips for studying effectively: aDon\u2019t spend hours at a time staring at the page. Use a time block for studying, such as 30 or 45 minutes. aTake short breaks after each study block. aStudy for your upcoming test frequently enough that you do not need to cram at the last minute. aSummarize each chapter with an outline or brief list of main points. aRewrite your notes, improving them as you go. aTeach the material to a family member or friend. aPractice answering sample test questions. 1. Make a schedule. Aim to study something every day. Break your study into chunks. Cramming at the last minute will cause you to panic\u2014especially when something new or unexpected appears on the test. 2. Preview chapters before class. Read the \ufb01rst and last paragraphs, the subheadings, and the \ufb01rst sentences in each paragraph. Look at pictures, charts, and graphs. Read any questions at the end of the chapter. 3. At the end of the day, skim your notes several times to help you remember the terms and main ideas. 4. Two days before your test, review dif\ufb01cult sections in your textbook and notes, then study the rest of the material less often. 5. Use two or more textbooks for the same material if available. Read the section in one, then the other. Teach the formula to a friend; then your brain will better grasp abstract or odd information. 6. Critical thinking is important for any successful test preparation. Try to understand each concept rather than just memorizing isolated facts. Consider what questions might be asked about the material. Think about how instructors might relate the information to other things you have learned. 7. Look for \u201chot spots\u201d in your textbook: those parts the instructor said were important; sample questions; information in charts or diagrams; and bold or italicized words. 8. Pay attention in class. It will reduce the amount of time you need to study. 9. Eat well and get a good night\u2019s sleep before your test. Exercise regularly\u2014it improves brain function. 10. If you \ufb01nd that you cannot recall a de\ufb01nition or formula, move on. You might need a break or more time to study. Don\u2019t panic. Take a few deep breaths, then try again. 11.

Try to catch yourself when you say negative things about your- self. For example, if you think, \u201cI\u2019m such a fool,\u201d rephrase the thought: \u201cThat was a careless thing to do,\u201d or \u201cMaybe I can learn from this.\u201d 3.  Be more assertive. Don\u2019t overapologize or feel you need to explain yourself all the time. 4.  Forgive yourself. If you have made mistakes, acknowledge the error, learn from it, and let it go. 5.  Monitor your self-esteem. Be aware when your self-esteem is high or low and what triggers changes in how you feel about yourself. 6.  Practice positive self-talk. For example, \u201cI\u2019m learning to be more patient,\u201d or \u201cI can handle this.\u201d 7.  Challenge your negative beliefs. Ask yourself if the negative belief is really true, or if you\u2019re just focusing on the negatives while ignoring the positives. 8.  Communicate better. Improving your communication skills with family and friends will give you a sense of control and con\ufb01dence as well as put you in touch with supportive people. 9.  Learn to accept compliments. Say, \u201cThank you,\u201d and try to believe that the compliment is sincere, even if at \ufb01rst you don\u2019t feel it is. 10.  Improve your skills.

Incorporate fun and joy into your daily life. 12.

After several decades of study and observation, researchers have arrived at a surprising conclusion: success doesn\u2019t depend so much on intelligence or talent as on daily habits. What we do repeatedly each day matters more than anything else. Here are some good habits to develop: 1. Make your bed in the morning. It\u2019s a small discipline, and an easy one, but a good habit to develop. It will start your day with success. If you make the bed, you will feel inclined to do another small chore, which will lead to another. Before you know it, you\u2019ll get ready for work with a feeling of accomplishment. You might call this a positive feedback loop, and it is. The little accomplishments feed success. Continuous success builds confidence. Before you know it, that habit can become a lifestyle. 2. Exercise regularly. Studies have shown that exercise actually improves brain function. 3. Spend some time each day in reading and learning something new. 4. Have a hard time focusing? Practice mindfulness meditation. This practice builds mental muscle and willpower so you can focus and get more done, stress less, and gain more enjoyment from life. 5. Have trouble getting sound, restful sleep? Make sure to avoid consuming caffeine later in the day. Develop a routine that helps you relax before bedtime.

This section suggests tips for making it easier to pack lunches that your family will enjoy. You may want to combine these tips to make more meals. For example, if a food can be used for more than one meal during the week, it will save you time. Also, prepare as many vegetables and fruits in advance as you can. This will make it easier and faster to pack lunches. Maintain Food Safety. Always wash your hands with soap and warm water before preparing food or eating. Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running tap water before packing or cooking. Never use soap or detergent to wash produce. When packing lunch, two tips can help keep food safe: \u2022 Use cases, insulated bags, and small freezer and refrigerator packs to keep cold foods cold. \u2022 Use wax paper, foil, plastic wrap, and leak-proof containers to keep foods from drying out and keep packaged foods from leaking on other lunch items.

Blockchain technology is a way to secure and store digital information using a complex system of computers. It makes it possible to build public, decentralized databases that are accessible anywhere at any time to anyone. This technology was developed for use with cryptocurrency, but it has many applications beyond digital currency. The technology consists of a digital ledger in which blocks of information are securely connected, or \u201cchained,\u201d together in a chronological sequence. Each block contains a record of transactions or other digital activities (e.g., contracts, data transfers). Once a block has been added to the blockchain, no one can reverse or change its contents without the approval of the network participants, which makes blockchain technology highly tamper-resistant and secure. However, the technology itself has limited value without an application that uses the technology in a way that bene\ufb01ts people, businesses, or other entities. For example, blockchain technology is the basis for bitcoin, an application that uses the blockchain as public ledger for all bitcoin transactions. Other applications are in the early stages of development. Why Is Blockchain Important? The potential use of blockchain technology goes beyond cryptocurrency to offer the following bene\ufb01ts:  \u2022 Increased transparency, because the source of public transactions can be easily tracked  \u2022 Avoidance of third-party validation, because anyone with access to the blockchain network can con\ufb01rm the veracity of blocks \u2022 Reduced risks of fraud or tampering with the system, because data cannot be altered without disrupting the entire chain  \u2022 Lower costs and enhanced speed of transactions \u2022 Improved ownership rights and legal chain of custody for digital property  \u2022 Easier data sharing  \u2022 Increased resilience to data loss What Are Some Common Terms?  \u2022 Node: A decentralized network device that stores and maintains individual copies of a blockchain and validates new blocks  \u2022 Smart contract: A computer algorithm that automatically executes, controls, or documents a legal contract based on the terms of the contract  \u2022 Token: An entry on a blockchain that represents something owned, such as a piece of digital property, digital memorabilia, or a digital license or access right  \u2022 Wallet: A digital address where tokens can be received, stored, sent, and tracked What Are the Disadvantages of Blockchain?  \u2022 Data added to the blockchain cannot be changed. While this is the primary factor in the security of blockchain data, erroneous or fraudulent data included in a blockchain cannot be reversed or removed.  \u2022 Costs and energy use are high for computers supporting some blockchain systems, such as bitcoin. \u2022 The complexity of blockchain may be dif\ufb01cult for some people and businesses to understand. Is the Use of Blockchain Regulated? At the moment, blockchain is generally not subject to any regulation unless it is used to support other regulated activity, such as securities trading.

Transactions on a blockchain can also record other types of data such as deeds, titles, and ownership records.

This can help calm your mind so that you are less bothered by the feelings that come with anxiety. It also allows you to recognize and accept unpleasant thoughts and feelings\u2014instead of trying to get rid of them or ignore them. One way to practice mindfulness is through meditation. During meditation, you focus your attention on one thing\u2014such as your breathing. When other thoughts enter your mind, you simply notice them and then bring your attention back to your breathing. The important thing in mindfulness is to bring your attention back to the present moment, over and over again, without criticizing yourself. Here are several ways to practice mindfulness. You might want to try different methods to see which one works best for you. 1. Mindful breathing . Pay attention to the rising and falling of your belly as you breathe. If you \ufb01nd yourself thinking about something else, gently bring your attention back to your breath. Do this for 5 to 10 minutes. 2. Mindful noticing , looking at the world around you. Notice colors, shapes, textures, and objects. 3. Mindful listening. Listen to the sounds of your surroundings. 4. Mindful feeling. Notice physical sensations caused by touch\u2014for example, the feeling of your feet on the \ufb02oor or your hands on your desk. 5. Mindful tasting. Notice the taste of food in your mouth. Chew slowly. This will help you slow down and focus on the taste of the food. 6. Mindful walking. Take your attention to the motions of your body as you walk. Notice the sensations of your body and feet touching and leaving the \ufb02oor. 7. Mindful showering. Feel the shower water as it touches your skin. Notice the sounds and the smell of the soap. 8. Mindful brushing. When brushing your teeth or hair, notice the weight, touch, and feel of the toothbrush or the hairbrush in your hand. 9. Mindful driving. Notice the traffic, your breath, and your hand on the steering wheel. 10. Mindful 5-4-3-2-1 exercise. This is a brief mindfulness exercise that can bring your attention to the present moment when you are feeling anxious or overwhelmed. \u2022 Notice 5 things that you see right now. Say each one out loud. \u2022 Notice 4 things that you feel right now. Say each one out loud. \u2022 Notice 3 things that you hear right now.

To Practice Mindfulness 1. Find a quiet place and get yourself into a comfortable posture. Get as comfortable as you can. 2. Close your eyes. 3. Breathe naturally and focus on the experience of each breath as it enters and leaves your body. Follow the breath, in and out, until you \ufb01nd a breathing rhythm that feels relaxed yet alert and natural. 4. Bring your complete attention to the experience of your breathing. When your mind wanders (and it will), notice the thoughts, feelings, or physical sensations pulling your attention away from your breathing, and gently redirect your attention to the breaths as they \ufb02ow in and out. 5. If you want, you can say quietly to yourself, for each breath: Relax, stay present. Many people \ufb01nd this helps them stay aware of the breath. Use a soft tone of voice; the phrase is just for you. 6. After 5 to 10 minutes, slowly open your eyes (if they were closed) and bring your awareness back to the room. To Practice Body Awareness 1. Find a quiet place and get yourself into a comfortable posture. 2. Focus your attention on one place in your body. The place can be anywhere you want but try to \ufb01nd a place that is neutral or pleasant in sensation (for example, the hands, legs, or abdomen). 3. Notice whatever sensation is in the spot you\u2019ve picked\u2014tingling, warmth, coolness, or perhaps numbness or pulsing. 4. Stay focused on the same spot for 5 to 10 minutes. If your mind wanders away, gently return it to this place in your body. 5. When the time is up, bring your attention back to the room around you. Some people find it helpful to tell themselves silently: \u201cRelax. Stay present.\u201d as they practice body awareness. Tips for Practicing Mindfulness and Body Awareness 1. Practice mindfulness and body awareness every day, before your test or procedure. Research shows that practicing mindfulness every day for even a few minutes can help reduce overall anxiety and depression. 2. You may want to try using guided mindfulness or body awareness meditations. 3. For these exercises, you do not need to completely clear your mind of thoughts, or to be free of fear or other distressing feelings and sensations. These exercises work even when fear is present. 4. Mindfulness is not another task or activity. It is an exercise in caring for yourself during a time when the normal cares of daily life have been joined by fear of illness and medical procedures. 5. These exercises are simple to do, but people often \ufb01nd the practice dif\ufb01cult to maintain. Be patient with yourself. It gets easier over time. 6.

Set a good example by making healthy food choices yourself. Foster good eating habits. If at all possible, have your child sit at a table for meals. Do not offer food as a reward for behavior, and do not withhold food as a way to punish or control your child. Plan meals to include components of a healthy diet (see \u201cDaily Food Group Guide for Preschool-Aged Children\u201d below) and limit sugar- sweetened beverages, 100% fruit juices, sweets, and salty snacks. Talk to your child about learning what foods help the body grow. Talk about how the colors of fruits and vegetables help keep the heart and stomach healthy. Kids who understand why their bodies need certain foods will come to expect those foods at every meal. Encourage your preschooler to taste new foods but don\u2019t force the issue. Continue to offer unfamiliar foods alongside favorites (especially fruits and vegetables). Offer only a few bite-sized pieces of the food at a time.

A healthy meal plan for diabetes includes the same foods recommended for everyone: a variety of nutrient-rich foods in moderate amounts, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and heart-healthy oils. It\u2019s important to eat foods with \ufb01ber, which can slow the rise in blood sugar after meals. Current guidelines recommend that people with diabetes consume 14 grams of \ufb01ber per 1,000 calories a day. The amount of carbohydrates you eat is the biggest factor in raise your blood sugar. To prevent big \ufb02uctuations in your blood sugar level, it\u2019s important to eat about the same amount of carbohydrate at each meal. However, you don\u2019t have to eat the exact same amount of carbohydrate or the same foods at every meal. Your body needs carbohydrate from meal to meal in fairly similar amounts, but if you\u2019re physically active, your needs can vary somewhat from day to day. When you\u2019re ready to eat or prepare a meal, aim for a target number of carbohydrate grams within 5 grams of that target. This helps you stick to your meal plan but provides you some \ufb02exibility to choose a variety of foods. To meet your diabetes management and nutrition goals, use these tips to develop the healthy eating plan that is right for you: 1.  Eat a consistent amount of carbohydrate, with a focus on nutrient- dense carbohydrate foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 2.  Include a source of protein at each meal and snack. 3.  Include heart-healthy unsaturated fats from nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils at each meal (or by moderation every day). 4.  Limit foods high in saturated and trans fats. 5.  Limit added sugars and sodium. 6.  Be physically active every day\u2014aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. 7.  Stay within a healthy weight range. 8.  Include alcohol in moderation (if you don\u2019t drink alcohol, don\u2019t start). For women, this means no more than one drink per day; for men, no more than two drinks per day. 9.  Don\u2019t skip meals. To keep your blood sugar steady, especially if you\u2019re taking insulin or some other diabetes meds, don\u2019t go more than 6 hours without eating. After you have planned your meals and snacks for the week, practice estimating the amount of carbohydrate grams in the foods on your plate. This will help you adjust your insulin dose\u2014especially for rapid-acting insulin\u2014increased activity, or both.

Break down a problem into sequences of instructions to be given to the computer. This is the problem-solving process. Then code those instructions using a programming language. 5. Before writing programs, work out by hand some typical inputs, outputs, and process steps on a piece of graph paper. Use a \ufb02owchart or pseudocode to develop a plan. (See 6.1 Algorithms  and 6.2 Flowcharts  for more on this.) 6. Test your programs on a variety of possible sets of inputs. The art of testing is an important part of programming. 7. Debug the programs by identifying the errors and correcting them. You\u2019ll learn to eliminate mistakes by using sample input data and verifying the output against expected results. 8.

Therefore, I believe strongly that it is still possible for skillful stockpickers to identify undervalued stocks and to achieve investment rewards greater than those of the overall market. The fact that most investment professionals fail to beat the market or to identify undervalued securities does not mean that it cannot be done.

Investing involves risk, so it is important to have a plan that will help you balance your \ufb01nancial goals with the level of risk you are willing to take. These steps can help you get started. Set Your Financial Goals Make a list of your \ufb01nancial goals. For example, you might want to save for a down payment on a home, for your child\u2019s college education, or for retirement. Consider two important factors for each goal:  1. When you will need the money. 2. How much money you will need. The amount you need and the time you\u2019ll be investing can in\ufb02uence your investment decisions. For example, if you\u2019re saving for a down payment on a home in a few years, you may not want to take too much risk with this money because you won\u2019t have time to recover from any losses. But since retirement savings are usually invested over many years, they can withstand changes in value from year to year before providing a long-term return. Learn About Your Investment Options Depending on your financial goals and risk tolerance, you can decide how to invest your money. Educate yourself on the types of investment products that are available to you. To get started, review the publications of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation listed at the end of this guide or visit d\ufb01.ca.gov. Consider Your Risk Tolerance and Time Frame Investing always involves some degree of risk. The amount of risk you are willing to accept (your  risk tolerance ) is a personal decision that depends on your \ufb01nancial situation, your investment goals, and your time frame. In general, the younger you are and the longer your time frame, the more risk you can accept. You may want to accept more risk if you are looking for high reward and can accept losses. But if you want to minimize losses or are content with average returns, you may want to accept less risk. Identify How Much Money You Can Invest Start by calculating your net worth by subtracting your liabilities (what you owe) from your assets (what you own). Your net worth will give you a picture of your current \ufb01nancial health and help you determine if you are prepared to begin investing. It\u2019s best to have no high-interest debt before you invest. Also, consider the amount of money you might need each month to maintain your lifestyle and the size of any emergency fund you have. Next, determine how much you can safely invest. As a general rule, you should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in cash or cash equivalents before investing. This emergency fund is used for unexpected expenses (job layoff, medical emergencies, etc.) and should be stored in a separate account. Continuing problems in the economy indicate that building up an emergency fund is even more important. Get Diversification With Different Types of Investments To reduce risk, you should spread your money among different types of investments. Taking this step reduces the risk that a decline in any one investment will severely reduce the value of your overall portfolio. It also reduces the risk that your entire investment portfolio will be negatively affected by specific market or economic events. Generally, the more risk you are willing to take, the more your investments are likely to be concentrated in growth investments such as stocks or stock mutual funds. If you want less risk and less volatility, you may want to emphasize income-producing or stability-focused investments such as bonds. Investors who want to minimize risk usually have a portfolio consisting mostly of bonds or even cash and cash equivalents. Create Your Investment Plan Now that you understand your investment options and risk tolerance, you can create your investment plan. Review your goals, time frame, and risk tolerance to build a portfolio with an appropriate mix of investments. As your circumstances change, you may want to update your investment plan to re\ufb02ect your new goals or change in risk tolerance or time horizon. 06/2024\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

For example, 50% of your investments might be in stocks; 30% in bonds; and 20% in cash. Asset allocation plays a major role in determining your overall returns. Keep in mind that how you personally divide up your assets is based largely on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Diversify within each investment category: Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.

Risk tolerance is de\ufb01ned as your ability and willingness to lose some or all of your original investment in exchange for greater potential returns. Your risk tolerance depends on many factors, including your age, your goals, your investment time frame, and your personality. Many human beings are risk averse, and they feel uncomfortable taking any risk at all. But most investments involve some risk. Generally, higher potential returns are associated with higher risks. So if you want an investment that has the potential to earn more money, you may have to accept greater risk. If you want to avoid risk, you may have to settle for a lower return. One of the best ways to determine your risk tolerance is to complete a questionnaire, such as the one presented in this chapter. There are also risk-tolerance questionnaires available on some \ufb01nancial services companies\u2019 websites. Other important concepts that you should understand before you start investing are explained in the following question and answer series.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Before you invest, it\u2019s important that you: 1. Familiarize yourself with different types of investment opportunities.

How much risk can you handle without selling in a panic during declining market conditions? If you haven\u2019t thought about risk tolerance before, don\u2019t worry. Most people discover theirs only after investing for a while. 3. Understand the power of compounding. Compounding means that your earnings generate further earnings over time. The earlier you start investing, the more powerful the effect of compounding over several decades. 4. Make a plan. Determine investment goals that are realistic, practical, and measurable. Your investment goals might include planning for retirement, setting aside money for a child\u2019s education, or saving for a major expense. 5. Decide whether to go it alone or get help. If you decide to work with an investment professional, be sure to check out the individual\u2019s quali\ufb01cations and background and understand how and what you will be charged. 6.

Even small amounts, invested regularly over many years, can grow into a sizable sum. But unlike simply saving money in a bank account, investing can be risky. You can lose some or all of the money you put into investments. However, investing can also offer greater rewards. Over its long-term history, the stock market has provided substantial growth in many people\u2019s savings. The key is knowing just enough about investing to make sound decisions\u2014without feeling overwhelmed. The important starting point is your own comfort level with risk. How much are you willing to see \ufb02uctuate in your investment portfolio, particularly in the short term? Once you decide that, you can build your portfolio accordingly. Only you can decide your level of risk tolerance. But to do that, you need to have a good understanding of how investing works and what kinds of risk are involved. What should I invest in initially? When you are just starting out with small amounts to invest, it may be best to start with a low-cost portfolio of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Such funds can provide you with diversi\ufb01cation and professional investment management. They\u2019re typically less risky than investing in just a few individual stocks or bonds. Also, many brokerage \ufb01rms today offer \u201crobo-advisors\u201d (online services that create and manage a diversi\ufb01ed portfolio for you) with minimal account fees, and without the need to speak to a human \ufb01nancial advisor. 232 Part 7: Princing Your Products Must I Pay Taxes on My Investments? When you sell an investment for a pro\ufb01t (known as a capital gain), you may have to pay capital gains tax on that income. How much you owe depends on how long you held the investment and how much you earned. In general, gains on investments that you have owned for more than one year are taxed at a more favorable rate than investments that you have owned for less than one year. Investments are usually tracked from the purchase date to the sale date. However, sometimes when you sell some shares but hold on to others, you can choose to sell the shares with the highest (or lowest) cost to minimize (or maximize) the capital gain. If you want to do this, you must tell your broker before you make the sale, and you must document it in writing within 30 days after the sale. Consult a tax specialist for more information on capital gains tax rules. 233 Part 7: Princing Your Products 8\\u0000\\u0000\\u0000.\\u0000 \u2018 6 G \\u0012 9 6 ! \\\"  + ? $ 4 , 4 234 Part 7: Princing Your Products 235 237 238 239 241 243 245 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 Part 7: Princing Your Products 257 259 260 261 263 264 265 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 287 288 289 290 291 [Continuous Proprietorship or Partnership] 293 [Incorporated Business] 295 298 299 300 [Presiding Judge may insert additional or alternative instructions on the calculation of damages for impairment of reputation and credit with the following options:] 301 302 303 304 305 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 321 322 323 324 325 326 328 329 330 331 332 334 335 336 337 338 339 341 342 343 344 345 347 348 349 350 351 352 [The parties have agreed that damages, if any, are limited to [specify amount or period].]\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Determine what you\u2019re investing for\u2014whether it\u2019s for retirement, education, buying a home, or another goal\u2014and the timeframe you have in mind for each. 2. Know your risk tolerance. Understand your comfort level with the ups and downs of the market, which can help determine the types of investments that are most appropriate for you. 3. Educate yourself about investment basics. Learn about different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc.) and how they typically perform. 4. Establish an emergency fund. Before investing, make sure you have enough cash set aside (usually three to six months\u2019 worth of living expenses) for unexpected needs. This will help you avoid having to sell investments at an inopportune time. 5. Start with retirement accounts. If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan, especially if there\u2019s an employer match, consider contributing to it. Also explore IRAs and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts. 6. Consider starting with low-cost, diversied mutual funds or ETFs. These can provide exposure to a broad market segment with less risk than individual stocks. 7. Use dollar-cost averaging. Invest a \ufb01xed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market\u2019s performance, to reduce the impact of volatility. 8. Monitor and rebalance your portfolio. Periodically review your investments and adjust to maintain your desired asset allocation. 9. Seek professional advice. Consider consulting with a \ufb01nancial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. 10. Continue learning.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to help machines improve at tasks with experience. Computer programs are created to analyze and learn from large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on the data. Machine learning can be used in a variety of applications, such as spam \ufb01ltering, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and image recognition.

Follow the instructions of the child\u2019s healthcare provider about how you can use a timer or a visual schedule to help the child get ready.

Repeat instructions and give warnings several minutes before it is time to switch to a new activity. Do the same activities in the same order every morning. A visual schedule that the child can see and feel might be more helpful than verbal instructions. A visual schedule can use photographs of each step or pictures of the steps: brush your teeth, wash your face, get dressed, eat breakfast, and so on. A visual schedule can also use words, depending on the child\u2019s level of understanding. Practice using the schedule every day so the child learns it well.

This type of stress can have harmful effects on your health. It is often caused by challenging circumstances in life, such as long-term illness, problems at work, or money troubles. What can I do? Relaxation techniques  Controlled breathing, progressive relaxation, visualization meditation, and yoga are all relaxation techniques that can be bene\ufb01cial for managing stress and promoting well-being.  Breathing control  Breathing control focuses on slow, deep, even breaths as a way to counter stress and anxiety. To do this, place your hand on your stomach so you can feel the movement. Breathe in deeply and evenly through your nose, several seconds at a time, feeling your stomach rise each time your lungs \ufb01ll. Then slowly breathe out. Each breath should take as long as the previous one. If you start to feel dizzy, breathe normally for a few breaths before continuing. Breathing control can be done anytime you feel stressed.  Progressive relaxation  Progressive relaxation involves slowing down your breathing and systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body. Find a quiet place and sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing for a minute or two. Think of each muscle group and tense the muscles for about 8 seconds, then slowly relax them. (The most difficult part of this exercise is to tighten the muscles \u2013 not relaxing them.) Concentrate on the difference in feelings between the tension and relaxation. Progressive relaxation exercises can be learned from books, tapes, or videos, or by an instructor. Visualization  Visualization uses your imagination to help ease stress. Imagine yourself in a peaceful, calming place or situation. Involve all your senses \u2013 sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Focus on your peaceful state in this place. As soon as your thoughts begin to wander, redirect them to the calmful scene. You can combine visualization with breathing control or progressive relaxation. Find a quiet place where you won\u2019t be disturbed. Yoga  Yoga involves practicing physical postures and breathing exercises to promote relaxation and well-being. You can learn yoga from a certi\ufb01ed instructor. Although it is bene\ufb01cial for most people, talk to your doctor before starting yoga if you have any medical conditions.  Meditation  Many types of meditation focus on centering your attention only on your breath or on a word or phrase that you say to yourself. It can help calm your mind and reduce stress. Many meditation techniques include sitting or lying down in a comfortable position, focusing on something simple, and disregarding distracting thoughts as they come. Guided meditation, in which an instructor directs you using spoken words or music, can be helpful when you are starting out. Coping skills  It also can help to set priorities, ask for help, say no to extra responsibilities you don\u2019t have time or energy for, and get organized. What else should I consider?
