In State Farm, the Supreme Court indicated that courts should consider three guideposts for determining whether the punitive damages award is reasonable and comensurate to the actual malice of the defendant: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of a defendant's misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. In BMW and State Farm, the Supreme Court also indicated that it is improper for punitive damages to be grossly excessive and that ratios ranging from a single-digit multiplier to a maximum of four to one are generally appropriate. In Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987), the Supreme Court held that \\\"the very notion of punitive damages presumes and calls for discretion on the part of the trier of fact\\\"; however, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) allows courts to alter or amend a judgment to consider whether a jury's punitive damage award was excessive.

It provides the principles of punitive damages and instructions relating to individual and corporate defendants, including the phases of a bifurcated trial for punitive damages. In the United States, a plaintiff may recover three types of monetary damages in a civil lawsuit: compensatory, nominal, and punitive. The purpose of punitive damages is to punish a defendant and to deter the defendant and others from engaging in similar activity. In Oregon, the law requires that there be two separate phases of trial or hearings if the plaintiff asks for punitive damages. The reason for having two phases is so that the standards for awarding punitive damages are not considered until after there has been a determination that the defendant is liable for actual damages. This also ensures that the question of whether the defendant is liable is resolved before the parties and the judge learn the amount of actual damages.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The principle of Punitive Damages-Individual and Corporate Defendants (Corporate Liability Based on Acts of Named Individual)-Bifurcated Trial (first Phase) provides general information about a type of procedure sometimes used in a punitive damages trial. A punitive damages trial is a trial to decide if an \\\"award of punitive damages\\\" (money to punish a defendant rather than to compensate the plaintiff for an actual loss) is appropriate under the circumstances, and if so, the exact amount. Under certain circumstances, a trial for punitive damages may be conducted in phases (\\\"bifurcated\\\"). In this type of procedure, the first trial phase is a determinaton of whether an award for punitive damages is appropriate. If it is, the trial proceeds to a second phase, in which the appropriate amount of the punitive damages award is determined. This principle relates to the first phase only. The procedure also varies slightly, depending upon whether punitive damages are sought against individual defendants, or against a corporation based on the wrongful acts of a named employee, as explained in more detail below.

Therefore, in the absence of an express provision of law to the contrary, the law of the case doctrine does not bar courts from admitting evidence of relative fault into the record when only a general verdict is requested. Additionally, the parties may expressly agree to submit only a general verdict to the jury. If parties waive their rights to a special verdict, a court must accept the waiver; otherwise, a trial judge would be empowered to overrule the parties' waiver and force them to use the special verdict form. However, a court has discretion whether to grant instruction on comparative fault, especially if it would involve a complicated jury instruction. It also has discretion regarding the allocation of fault among the defendants. Fayette County, IL v. City of Chicago, IL, 824 F.2d 1127, 1131-1134 (7th Cir. 1987) (internal citations omitted).

County of Los Angeles, 768 F.2d 357 - Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit 1985 The case involves the question of whether county employees'' actions in accepting a grant of immunity from the state and thereby ''waiving the liability limition contained in California Government Code section 815.6,\\\" gives rise to federal law claims. Plaintiffs filed suit against the City of Los Angeles; the Mayor of Los Angeles; the City Council for Los Angeles; the City Attorney of Los Angeles; the Los Angeles Police Department; the Department of Mental Health of Los Angeles County; Dr. Daniel Smith; Dr. Martin Fliegel; Dr. William Friedman; Dean Cambias; and Joan Kraft. They allege violations of: the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Rehabilitation Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act; sections 1983, 1985(3) and 1986 of the United States Code; and the California Constitution. Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for medical expenses; punitive damages; nominal damages; injunctive relief; declaratory relief; attorney's fees; and costs. Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit affirms summary judgment and reverses preliminary injunction against City's commitment procedures. In the Matter of the Commitment of Taylor, 24 P.3d 587, 582 CO 95 - Supreme Court of Colorado 2001 Pursuant to COLO.REV.STAT. (C.R.S.) 27-65-102, a person is gravely disabled when by reason of a mental illness the person is in danger of serious harm due to a failure to provide for his or her essential needs of health or safety. At issue is whether, in order to be \\\"gravely disabled,\\\" is the person required to be unable to provide for his or her essential needs under any and all circumstances, or whether being unable to provide for one's needs in usual circumstances under normal influences may suffice to establish grave disability. Court of Appeals of Indiana - Division I 2005 The State of Indiana is also a petitioner here. Judicial review whether state law violates federal law. In the Matter of the Commitment of Joseph, 143 P.3d 578 - Supreme Court of the State of Washington 2006 Under chapter 71.05 RCW, a person with a mental disorder can be involuntarily committed if that person is dangerous to other persons or gravely disabled. SHB, a state hospital patient who was not on treatment for his mental disorder at that time, was involuntarily committed for treatment. THB, the Police Chief of the town where SHB resided, filed a petition for an order of involuntary treatment. A hearing was convened to determine whether SHB should be involuntarily treated. The trial court ruled that SHB was gravely disabled as proscribed by chapter 71.05 RCW, and ordered involuntary treatment. SHB appealed. Supreme Court of the State of Washington affirms prior decision. Under chapter 71.05 RCW, a person with a mental disorder can be involuntarily committed if that person is dangerous to other persons or gravely disabled. THB, the Police Chief of the town where SHB resided, filed a petition for an order of involuntary treatment. A hearing was convened to determine whether SHB should be involuntarily treated. The trial court ruled that SHB was gravely disabled as proscribed by chapter 71.05 RCW, and ordered involuntary treatment. SHB appealed.

At first glance, this rule might seem to guarantee that an innocent person will not be punished. After all, if there is reasonable doubt, the defendant must be found not guilty. In practice, however, innocent persons have been and are punished. The standard is a high one, but it does not require absolute certainty.    What exactly does the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt mean? The phrase is to be understood in its \\\"common and approved usage\\\" or as the people of a jurisdiction understand it. Inmodel jury instructions for a criminal case, the United States Department of Justice states that       Reasonable doubt is doubt based upon reason and common sense. It is not mere possible doubt, but is such a doubt as would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. If, after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty, the doubt has been removed from your mind. On the other hand, if you think there is a reason to believe he may not be guilty, you have a reasonable doubt.    Objections have been raised to the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt. Some critics have noted that courts largely have refused to define reasonable doubt, that jurors do not necessarily understand the term in the same way, and that when the concept of reasonable doubt is defined, the definitions differ and vary in quality. Other critics have argued that the functions of the reasonable doubt standard have been taken over by the presumption of innocence, that the difference between preponderance of the evidence and reasonable doubt has become unclear, and that because scientific evidence is evaluated statistically, there can be no reasonable doubt about guilt. Some have suggested that jury deliberations be studied or that people withlowa ctivation in the amygdalae (brains areas responsible for processing social and emotional reactions) be excluded from jury service in heavily emotional cases. One proposal to address the vagueness of the standard would be to provide jury instructions that proscribe quantitative standards such as a 90% degree of certainty that a defendant is guilty.    On the other hand, it has been argued that the presumption of innocence and the obligation to prove a fact beyond a reasonable doubt are intertwined and must be viewed \\\"in conjunction with each other.\\\" It has been further argued that the standard merely guides the jury's conscience and that the test for wrongful conviction must be \\\"whether the judgment was consistent with the 'conscious will' of the finder of fact.\\\" It is reasonable to doubt dating violence prevention, persons, United States department of justice, U.S. department of justice, legal information institute, Cornell law school\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":1,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"If you are accused of committing a crime, the prosecution has the obligation to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

For example, trustees of a trust have a fiduciary duty to the trust beneficiaries to prudently manage and invest trust assets.    The duty of loyalty requires directors and officers to put the corporation's interests ahead of their own. It requires them to avoid conflicts of interest when possible, or to fully disclose any conflicts. Conflicts of interest may arise in the case of self-dealing or when directors or officers usurp a corporate opportunity for themselves. Self-dealing occurs if they engage in any transaction with the corporation, directly or on behalf of another party that benefits personally from the transaction. To usurp a corporate opportunity is to take for one's self a business opportunity that a corporation might be interested in.    They are protected if:       - The transaction was fair to the corporation, or    - The material facts of the transaction and their interest in it were disclosed or known to the board, and the board approved, or    - The material facts of the transaction and their interest in it were disclosed or known by the shareholders, and the shareholders approved.       With certain exceptions, officers and directors are not liable for monetary damages to the corporation for breach of duty, if they meet the above standards. Under some circumstances, they may be personally liable for penalties under federal securities laws enforcement actions.

Some of these duties include the following: to act solely in the interests of the client in all matters within the scope of the agency; to seek a sale or purchase at the price and upon the terms authorized by the client; to disclose to the client all information that the agent knows or should know and that might reasonably affect the client's ability to receive fair and full compensation; to maintain the confidentiality of any information given to the agent by the client for a reasonable time after termination of the agency, except as to matters to which the client has consented or as to which disclosure is required by law; to timely account to the client for all money and property received; to obey all lawful instructions and to act reasonably and with due care. Most specifically with respect to disclosure, the real estate broker shall disclose to the client adverse material facts involving the property.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

They do not have all the transfer cases. They only have ones most related to the four transfer rules.    Section 8 of Public Law 108-7 explains the transfer rules and why the Congress thought these rules were necessary.    These transfer rules became law because many veterans were transferred from higher paying pension rates to lower paying rates. Many were transferred without proper notice and without the opportunity to reply. The Congress made the rules to protect veterans.    The Labor Department administers a pension program similar to VA's but for civilian Federal employees. Labor's program has transfer rules very similar to VA's. Cases decided on Labor's transfer rules are helpful when trying to understand VA's transfer rules.    Transfer means the military service or the receipt of certain Veterans' benefits was first used to establish one type of Veterans' benefit. Later, the military service or the receipt of Veterans' benefits was used to establish another Veterans' benefit. When the second benefit was established, the first benefit was terminated.    Parrish v. West, 180 F. Supp. 2d 65 (D.D.C. 2001), explains the transfer rules. The Court found that the Department of Veterans Affairs was wrong to transfer veterans without notify them. In that case, many of the veterans never learned they had been transferred for many years.     Parrish v. Peake, 483 F.3d 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2007) is the appeal of Parrish v. West, 180 F. Supp. 2d 65 (D.D.C. 2001).    Barth v. West, 9 Vet. App. 42, 46 (1996) says how to tell when there is a lack of notice.    Edmond v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 299 (2009) - For a transfer to operate retroactively to the effective date of the later-established benefit, the veteran must have had notice of the transfer on or before the effective date of the later-established benefit. A notice of transfer issued after the effective date of the later-established benefit is not sufficient to make the transfer operate retroactively. It is the Court's conclusion that the key transfer statute does not authorize retroactive transfer for time periods prior to the date of notice.     Mays v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 41 (2011) states that VA gave the correct notice when it transferred Mr. Mays.

The three-year statutory period for actual fraud begins to run from the date plaintiff discovered, or might through reasonable diligence have discovered, the fraud. The discovery rule allows for tolling of the statutory period. Section 338(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an action for relief on the grounds of fraud must be commenced within three years \\\"after the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud\\\". The statute of limitations for actual fraud does not begin to run until the fraud is, or should have been, discovered. The discovery rule applies to both actual and constructive fraud. The Attorney General's staff determined that a cause of action for constructive fraud against a public entity's employees or agents accrues upon the occurrence of such fraud, unless delayed accrual results from the application of the discovery rule or the doctrine of equitable tolling. The two-year statutory period for constructive fraud begins to run from the time plaintiff sustains the actual damage, not from the time the deceptive practice occurred. Under California's Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), section 3439.09 of the Civil Code sets forth the statute of limitations with respect to actions for actual and constructive fraud.

Termination of tenancy of less than one month  (a) Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, a tenancy having a period of less than one month may be terminated at any time by a written notice given at least one full period of tenancy prior to the intended termination date. If a notice is given other than in the way provided in subdivision (a) of Section 1940, then two additional days shall be added to the full period of tenancy.    (b) A tenancy having a period of less than one week shall terminate upon the expiration of the period of the tenancy following the expiration of the minimum period of notice required.  If a notice is given other than in the way provided in subdivision (a) of Section 1940, then two additional days shall be added to the period of the tenancy.          1946.1. Termination of month-to-month tenancy: 60-day written notice    Except as provided in this section or in Section 1946.2, to terminate or create a month-to-month tenancy, the landlord or tenant must give the other party a written notice at least one rental period in advance, with the rental period being determined in accordance with paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 827 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  For tenancies that are one month or longer, the one rental period advance notice to terminate the tenancy under this section shall not be shorter than 30 days.  Where the tenant has occupied the rental unit for less than one year and the tenant is not a senior citizen, disabled person, or disabled veteran (as defined by the State Department of Veterans Affairs), the landlord shall have no obligation under this section to provide a written reason for terminating the month-to-month tenancy.     Except as provided in this section or in subdivision (b) of Section 1946.2, to terminate or create a week-to-week tenancy, the landlord or tenant must give the other party written notice at least one week prior to the effective date of the termination or creation of the tenancy. Whenever a particular act is to be performed at or before a specified time and no period for performance is prescribed by law or contract, such act shall be performed within a reasonable time.    (a) Termination of tenancy upon sale of mobilehome park. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including subdivision (a) of Section 1946, a landlord of a mobilehome park under a month-to-month tenancy must give the tenant at least 60 days' written notice to terminate the tenancy if the landlord has entered into a contract to sell the mobilehome park or otherwise transfer ownership of the park. An owner of a mobilehome pursuant to a lease or agreement entitled to possession of a lot is a tenant within the meaning of this subdivision.     (b) Termination upon foreclosure; reason; dispute. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a landlord under a month-to-month tenancy may not terminate the tenancy upon a foreclosure sale of the leased premises before the expiration of 60 days following written notice to terminate the tenancy. The landlord shall also provide to the tenant a statement of specific facts constituting the reason for a termination other than a foreclosure sale of the leased premises. Nothing in this subdivision affects the right of a landlord or a tenant to terminate a month-to-month tenancy upon the expiration of the usual one rental period advance notice, unless the tenant has occupied the rental for at least one year, in which case the landlord must give a 60 day written notice, except as provided in subdivision (a). The tenant may dispute the reason for termination only as prescribed in Section 1167 of the Code of Civil Procedure.    (c) Exception to one rental period notice for eviction; sale of park. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever an unlawful detainer action has been filed against a tenant in a mobilehome park, the landlord may give at least one rental period's written notice to the tenant to vacate within that period. Nothing in this section shall affect the tenancy of any tenant who has right of possession over a mobilehome that is sold with a first security interest, except that a new owner of such mobilehome who is an occupant has no right of possession once the first security interest for which the mobilehome was sold is judicially foreclosed.

You may wish to consult an attorney.     Defense    Citation    Summary       Implied Warranty of Habitability    Garcia v. Hochman, 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 411 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006)    Also known as a warranty of habitability, this is the implied promise to provide safe and adequate housing. Housing that violates the building code or municipal health code is not considered adequate and fails to meet this warranty. Maintenance, building, and sanitation codes may require repairs such as the following: provide functioning electrical outlets, supply of hot water, sewer facilities, pest extermination, working and locking bathrooms, flooring, and adequate heat supply.     Implied Warranty of Habitability    Hitchcock v. Madsen, 105 Idaho 85, 665 P.2d 1287 (1983)    The implied warranty of habitability applies to all rental and residential tenancies except for transient stays such as at a motel, hotel, or boarding house. It should be borne in mind that the landlord-tenant relationship is essentially different from the relationship between a vendor and purchaser of goods. When a vendor sells goods to a purchaser, the entire consideration passes to the vendor at the time of the sale. On the other hand, under the lease or rental contract for property, the entire consideration is not paid at the time of the lease or rental, but only from time to time during the lease or rental in exchange for the right to exclusive possession and occupancy of the property for the period of time covered by the payment. It is this characteristic of the tenancy which permits a tenant to terminate the lease or rental agreement and quit the premises when the landlord has not repaired the premises due to the tenant's giving the landlord proper written notice of the need for repairs and a reasonable opportunity to make the repairs.     Implied Warranty of Habitability    Krolop v. Collins, 604 N.E.2d 1273 (Ind. Ct. App. 1992)    A landlord is obligated to repair conditions which cause the premises to be unsafe, unsanitary or unfit for human habitation. Under these circumstances, the tenant is entitled to a rebate in an amount proportional to the diminution in the value of the premises.     Implied Warranty of Habitability    Wilson v. Packard, 243 Va. 89, 413 S.E.2d 855 (1992)    Because of the variety of commercial uses to which premises can be put, there is no implied warranty of habitability.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"These United States court decisions support the affirmative defense\u00e2\u20ac\u201dimplied warranty of habitability:  - Abad v.

Under the law, employees who can perform the essential functions of their jobs have a duty to cooperate with their employer's efforts to accommodate their disabilities.

S. Code \u00c2\u00a7 12112 - Definition of discrimination with respect to employment Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment. It applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments. Employment agencies and labor organizations are also covered. To enforce the employment provisions, the Attorney General has adopted regulations providing standards and procedures. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces these provisions and has adopted its own regulations providing standards and procedures. One of the specific purposes of the ADA is to prohibit discrimination in employment against a qualified individual on the basis of that individual's disability. For purposes of this chapter, the term \\\"discriminate\\\" and related terms mean - (1) not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity; .... 29 U. S. Code \u00c2\u00a7 794 - Rehabilitation Act; employment A. prohibits the federal government, and programs that receive federal financial assistance, from discriminating against someone with a disability. It applies to all government agencies, employment, and to programs and activities that receive federal funds. The law also requires that federally funded programs and activities be accessible to persons with disabilities. The law is similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the courts often refer to decisions made under the ADA when interpreting the Rehabilitation Act. Court decisions about sections of the ADA other than employment can also be used to help interpret the Rehabilitation Act. This section prohibits discrimination in federally assisted programs and activities. It states, in part, that \\\"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ....\\\" Present law prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with handicaps in federally assisted programs. For the purpose of enforcing the prohibition, and implementing the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Attorney General is authorized to promulgate regulations, which may make exceptions regarding grants to religious organizations; and apply non-discrimination requirements to certain health or welfare agencies. The Act requires that federally assisted programs-voting, education, museums, medical care, transportation, parks, libraries, day care and others-be accessed by people with disabilities to the maximum extent possible. If buildings frequented by the public are altered, removed or newly constructed they must be accessible to persons with disabilities. Federal departments and agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent practicable in effecting compliance with the requirements of any federally assisted program or activity with respect to which such department or agency exercises supervisory authority. B. prohibits public housing agencies from discriminating against qualified handicapped persons in all aspects of the housing programs they administer and requires such agencies to make reasonable accommodation of policies, practices, or procedures when such accommodation is necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy accommodations and facilities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for enforcing this requirement. C. prohibits employers receiving federal funds from discriminating against a qualified person with a handicap in all aspects of employment including hiring, advancement or discharge from employment, compensation, job training opportunities, and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. Those employers who received funds are required to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the qualified individual unless doing so places an undue hardship on the employer. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing this requirement. Federal Contractors must also comply with the nondiscrimination and affirmative action provisions of Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act.

The contract in this case contained a warranty. The warranty stated that the owner could not recover damages for breach of the contract because the contractor promised that the work under the contract would conform to the plans and specifications and that any failure to conform would be corrected. The warranty stated that it survived acceptance of the work.    Does this type of warranty prevent the owner from recovering damages for breach of the contract? We find no case in Washington addressing whether this type of warranty prevents the owner from recovering damages for breach of a construction contract. For that reason, we turn to the authority in other jurisdictions.    An analagous issue that several jurisdictions have addressed is whether a contractor may disavow any liability for consequential damages for a breach of contract. We have relied on such cases in the past when interpreting contracts of service. Generally, courts have upheld such waivers, but have construed them narrowly to exclude only those damages that could not be expected in light of the circumstances of the parties at the time of contracting. See, e.g., Netcraft Corp. v. Flame Tech, Inc., 126 Wash. App. 584, 594, 109 P.3d 232 (2005) (in the absence of any other construction, narrowly construing a limitation of liability under a service contract).    Similarly, a majority of courts that have considered a warranty disallowing damages for breach of a construction contract have concluded that the warranty bars remedies other than allowing the owner to compel the work or have the contractor do the work at its expense. See Gleeson v. Kinslow Bros. Logging Co., 289 Or. 1, 609 P.2d 397, 404 (1980) (listing cases supporting this view); cf. Elizabeth T. Sullivan, Annotation, Contractor's Liability Under Building Contract When Building Does Not Conform to Plans and Specifications, 12 A.L.R. 4th 38 (1982) (citing cases holding that a nonconforming building is a breach of contract even if it is a substantial performance).    We agree that the primary remedy available to an owner under this type of warranty is to compel the contractor to do the work or have the contractor do the work. We also conclude, however, that resale is a remedy in equity to be ordered at the discretion of the court.        Instruction    The contractor has a warranty that the work under the contract will conform to the plans and specifications and that any failure to conform will be corrected. If you find that the work or improvements constructed by the contractor do not conform to the plans and specifications, the court may order that the deficiency be corrected by the contractor at the contractor's expense. Once the cost of correcting any deficiency is determined, the court will specify a further date for completion of the work, which must be a reasonably sufficient period of time after the court's determination.     When the work is not completed as ordered by the court, the owner may obtain the work at the contractor's expense. If the owner obtains the work, the contractor is liable in damages for any additional expense reasonably incurred by the owner. If the court finds that it is impractical to have the work done by the contractor, the owner may obtain the work from someone else.    An owner has a duty to mitigate damages, including any reasonable expense involved in obtaining work done by the contractor or another.        No automatic recovery of lost profit    You should not find for the owner on the ground that the work failed to conform to the contract simply because the work was not done by the contractor. To recover on this ground, the owner must prove all the elements necessary to recover damages. Specifically, nothing herein requires automatic recovery of lost profit.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"The purpose of this instruction is to explain to the jury the measure of damages to which the plaintiff, as a contract owner, is entitled in case of a breach of a construction contract when the work completed does not conform to the contract.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":4,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Though the wording may be slightly different, most instructions convey the same essential information to the jury.

In determining if the plaintiff has met this burden, you should compare the evidence which supports the proposition to the evidence which is opposed to it.    In this case the parties have stipulated that an oral contract existed between them. The plaintiff claims that the defendant breached the oral contract by not paying full compensation for extra work that was approved by the defendant before the extra work was performed or completed.     The plaintiff asks you to award damages for this breach. If you find that the plaintiff has proven that the defendant breached the oral contract, then you may award damages in an amount that will compensate the plaintiff for the loss it sustained as a direct result of the defendant's breach. A claimant is not entitled to recover damages for loss that the claimant could have avoided without undue risk, burden or humiliation.     The plaintiff must prove that the damages it seeks were sustained as a natural and probable consequence of the breach or were within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.

Quantifying the value of the work done before the abandonment involves resolving two issues. The first issue is whether to value the work done before the abandonment using the contract price, adjusted for credit that the non-breaching party is entitled to, or to use the value of the work as proven by the contractor.    The contract price is the amount the contractor agreed to be paid; this number is on page 3 of the contract. If you use the contract price, you must deduct any amounts the owner has already paid to the contractor for the work done before abandonment. You may also deduct amounts that represent the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damages for delay and any diminution in value of the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property resulting from the work done before the abandonment. Alternatively, you may determine the value of the work done before abandonment by determining the reasonable value of the work as proven by the contractor. The reasonable value of the work is the value of the work agreed to be done by the contract shown by other work comparable to that agreed to be done by the contract.    The second issue is whether an amount should be deducted from the amount allowed to the contractor for damage due to the contractor's failure to complete the contract. For example, if a contractor abandoned a construction contract before some work, the contract may allow a property owner to employ someone else to complete the contract. If the owner did this, it may have cost less to employ someone else than to have the contractor complete the contract. Thus, the owner may be entitled to a credit for the difference between what it cost the owner to have the work completed and the contract price. The reasonable cost of having the remaining work completed is the amount agreed to by the parties or, if they were unable to agree, the amount found by the jury or determined by the court (depending on whether the contract between the owner and the new contractor was a written contract or an oral contract).\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Compensation for excusable delay may be granted if the contractor so requests and meets certain requirements. Compensation for nonexcusable delay is usually denied.  Acceleration. After a delay, the contractor may be able to accelerate the work to meet the contract completion date. And, the owner may order the work to be accelerated.

If you decide that the plaintiff failed to prove any essential part of the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence, you must find in favor of the defendant.    The defendant contends that the complaint is barred by a time limit contained in the law, called a statute of limitations. A statute of limitations requires a claim in a lawsuit to be filed within a specific time period. When the specific time period has passed, the claim is said to be barred.    Under the law, if you decide the defendant has established that the claim in the complaint is barred, then your verdict should be in favor of the defendant. However, the law recognizes certain exceptions to a statute of limitations. One of these exceptions contains a specific time limit for bringing an action based on latent construction defect. For purposes of this exception, a latent defect is defined as a defect in a building that could not be discovered by reasonable inspection before the expiration of the one-year statute of limitation for injury to property. The exception provides that an action based on a latent construction defect must be commenced within 10 years after the substantial completion of the improvement to real property, not including additions or alterations that individually cost more than 5 percent of the original contract price or $25,000, whichever is less, or which increase the total floor area of the structure by more than 10 percent of the original floor area, whichever is less. The exception also allows a tolling of the statute of limitations during any period in which the damage was not discovered and could not reasonably have been discovered.
