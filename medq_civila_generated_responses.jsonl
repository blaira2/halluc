A chest X-ray may show a suspicious mass in the lungs, but this test cannot determine if the mass is cancerous.  Computed tomography (CT) scan After the chest X-ray, a CT scan is often the next test performed. The scan produces detailed cross-sectional images of the body. The CT scan helps further evaluate chest abnormalities shown on a chest X-ray. It may also help determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Sputum cytology examination  A sample of sputum may be examined under a microscope by a pathologist to look for cancer cells. This test is most useful for lung cancers that have spread to the larger airways. Tissue biopsy A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if cancer cells are present. The pathologist may run additional tests on the biopsy sample to help \ufb01nd the best treatment for the patient. There are many different techniques for obtaining a biopsy sample, including: Fine needle aspiration biopsy  A thin needle is guided through the chest wall into the lung mass to withdraw a small amount of tissue for examination. This procedure is usually performed by a radiologist [a doctor specializing in medical imaging, US] or pulmonologist [lung specialist]. It is often performed using a CT or ultrasound scan to guide placement of the needle. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsy  Using ultrasound along with a bronchoscope , a specially trained pulmonologist inserts a \ufb02exible viewing instrument (bronchoscope) through the mouth or nose and down into the lungs. The ultrasound guides the physician as a small needle is inserted through the wall of the airway into a lymph node to collect a sample. Fluorescence bronchoscopy  A bronchoscope with a special blue light is used to visually examine the lining of the airways. These areas can also be biopsied during the procedure. Narrow band imaging  Specially designed bronchoscopes called \u201cSlimScopeTM\u201d and \u201cSuperDimensionTM\u201d have been developed to better identify malignant lesions. Suspected cancerous lesions light up when illuminated by blue-green light. The lesions can also be biopsied during this procedure. Surgical biopsy  During thoracoscopy  or thoracotomy , a surgeon removes a small part of the lung or a lymph node for examination. Thoracoscopy (video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS) is a minimally invasive procedure in which a surgeon operates through several small incisions in the chest using a tiny camera and specialized instruments. Thoracotomy is an open surgical procedure with a single large incision that allows direct access to the chest organs. After examining the tissue, a pathologist can usually determine whether lung cancer is present as well as identify the lung cancer cell type.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}"]}

Other symptoms include obstructions and perforations of the colon, weight loss, and ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen). Nearly half of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, which may bleed or cause obstruction when they grow larger. It is possible to detect cancer early or even prevent it by identifying and removing adenomatous polyps. If colon cancer is suspected, the colon and rectum should be examined via colonoscopy or \ufb02exible sigmoidoscopy (a procedure that covers the \ufb01rst 60 cm of the colon). These procedures allow biopsies to be taken and polyps to be removed. Colonoscopy can detect lesions accurately. The sensitivity of sigmoidoscopy can be improved by adding a barium enema or CT colonography (a procedure that uses x-rays to obtain an image of the colon).

The diagnosis of Best disease involves a combination of clinical examination, family history, specialized retinal imaging, and electrophysiological testing. [1]  Key elements of the diagnostic workup include: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 1. Clinical Examination : A fundoscopy often reveals yellowish, egg yolk-shaped lesions in the macula during the early stages. Over time, these lesions may progress through various stages, including pseudohypopyon, vitelliruptive (scrambled egg), atrophic, and fibrotic stages. 2. Family History : Best disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance. A positive family history supports the diagnosis. 3. Electro-oculogram (EOG) : The EOG is crucial in diagnosing Best disease and usually reveals a reduced Arden ratio (ratio of light peak to dark trough), often less than 1.5, indicating dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium. [2] 4. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) : OCT can detect and characterize the accumulation of subretinal material, disruptions in the photoreceptor layers, and macular edema. 5. Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) Imaging : FAF highlights abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin within the retinal pigment epithelium. 6. Electroretinogram (ERG) : Full-\ufb01eld ERGs in Best disease patients are generally normal, which helps differentiate it from other retinal dystrophies. 7. Genetic Testing : Identification of mutations in the  BEST1  gene provides con\ufb01rmatory evidence and facilitates family counseling. 8. Fluorescein Angiography (FA) : Though less frequently used now due to the availability of OCT and FAF, FA may show a window defect corresponding to the atrophic retinal pigment epithelium and leakage if choroidal neovascularization is present. 9. Staging : Clinical and imaging \ufb01ndings are used to classify Best disease into several stages, which may be useful for prognosis and management.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":2,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy is diagnosed based on characteristic clinical examination \ufb01ndings, imaging studies, and electrophysiologic testing. It predominantly affects the macula, but extramacular involvement has been described in some cases. Vitelliform Lesions Are the Hallmark of Best Disease  In the early stage of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, the affected eye exhibits a classic yellow, egg yolk\u2013shaped lesion in the macula (vitelliform lesion), while visual acuity may remain unaffected. Over time, this can evolve into more complex retinal atrophic lesions (pseudohypopyon, vitelliruptive, and atrophic stages) with worsening central vision. Other \ufb01ndings include a hyperpigmented ring surrounding the vitelliform lesion and subretinal neovascular membranes. 1. Funduscopic examination  Best disease is best seen on funduscopic examination, which typically reveals the yellow, lipofuscin-rich vitelliform lesion in the macula 2. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF)  FAF imaging reveals increased autofluorescence corresponding to the vitelliform lesion due to accumulation of lipofuscin and can provide useful information for staging the disease 3. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)  OCT demonstrates a space-occupying vitelliform lesion between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neurosensory retina, with a homogenous high-intensity signal 4. Electrophysiologic testing  The electro-oculogram (EOG) shows a diminished Arden ratio less than 1.5 (normal >1.8) in both eyes, indicating impaired RPE function, which helps differentiate Best disease from other macular dystrophies.

Beta ketothiolase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAT1 gene. Normal Function of the ACAT1 Gene The ACAT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta-ketothiolase. Beta-ketothiolase is found inside mitochondria, specialized structures that serve as power generators within cells. Beta-ketothiolase joins two molecules called acyl-CoA molecules, playing an important role in two vital chemical processes: the breakdown of isoleucine, a type of amino acid found in proteins and the processing of ketone bodies, a fuel source used by the brain. Mutations in the ACAT1 gene reduce or eliminate beta-ketothiolase activity, impairing isoleucine breakdown and ketone body utilization.

Transplanted islets require that immune suppression drugs be taken continuously. They do not usually restore the production of insulin to normal. But the treatment has helped many people to keep their blood sugar under control and avoid insulin injections. Over the past 20 years, researchers have studied how to help islet cells survive without antibodies suppressing their rejection in a recipient\u2019s body. This would allow cells from a donor pancreas to be transplanted into the patient\u2019s body without the toxic side effects of continuous immune suppressive therapy. New knowledge about the endocrine cell differentiation process has opened the possibility of generating large quantities of new islets from abundant sources of cells for transplantation. These include: \u2022 Human adult stem cells found in the pancreas \u2022 Embryonic human stem cells \u2022 Cells in the liver that can be converted into pancreatic cells \u2022 Derivatives of human fetal duct cells \u2022 Pancreatic progenitor cells found in the adult pancreas Researchers have had limited success in replicating pancreatic and islet cells, but few have survived and functioned properly in the bodies of patients. Phase 3 clinical trials are currently under way in various centers in the United States to help researchers learn who they can best treat with islet cell transplantation and to improve long-term results.\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"annotations\":[],\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}", "{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"index\":3,\"logprobs\":null,\"message\":{\"content\":\"Islet cell transplantation is a procedure in which insulin-producing islet cells from a deceased donor are purified and transferred to a person with severe type 1 diabetes.

Diabetes is a disease in which the islet cells no longer produce insulin or the body is unable to use insulin effectively. Diabetes can cause serious complications, including blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and even death. People with type 1 diabetes usually need to take insulin for the rest of their lives. In islet cell transplantation, the islet cells are injected into the portal vein of the liver, where they can begin to produce insulin.

In people with severe type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islet cell transplantation may restore the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin and control blood sugar levels.

Men\u2019s life expectancy is substantially shorter, and the gap has continued to increase in recent years. Diseases related to tobacco use, high risk-taking behavior, and poor health care are important factors in this disparity. Moreover, men use medical services less frequently than women, contributing to the lower likelihood that many health problems will be detected early and treated effectively.  Aging is the most important risk factor for developing many serious illnesses. The health of older adults determines their ability to live independently and participate in society, as well as their need for social services. Men experience a more gradual increase in risk of health decline between midlife and oldest ages, while women show a rapid increase in risk in old-old age. In 2020, average life expectancy at birth was 75.1 years for men and 80.5 years for women.  Men experience high rates of illness from many chronic diseases and other health problems. For example, 50% more men than women have diabetes, and about 6 in 10 men have heart disease. Leading causes of death for men are as follows:  1. Heart disease (about 30% of male deaths in 2021)  2. Cancer (about 25%)  3. COVID-19 (about 6%)  4. Unintentional injuries (about 7%)  5.
