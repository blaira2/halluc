The trial court concluded that it may and we agree. So long as the other contracting party continues to demand performance of the increased scope of work, and in the absence of any conﬂicting provision of the contract, the contractor may continue to work after unsuccessful negotiations and subsequently recover the value of that work.

In other areas, however, the Legislature’s intent to reshape the rules governing construction defect actions is patent. Where common law principles had foreclosed recovery for defects in the absence of property damage or personal injury the Act supplies a new statutory cause of action for purely economic loss. And, of direct relevance here, even in some areas where the common law had supplied a remedy for construction defects resulting in property damage but not personal injury, the text and legislative history reﬂect a clear and unequivocal intent to supplant common law negligence and strict product liability actions with a statutory claim under the Act.” ( McMillin Albany LLC, supra,  4 Cal.5th at p. 249, internal citations omitted.)
