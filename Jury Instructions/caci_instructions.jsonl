For example, a witness testiﬁes that he saw only the white trail that jet planes often leave.

Instead, those factors are ones that a medical expert may rely upon in forming his or her expert medical opinion.” ( Davis v. Honeywell Internat. Inc.

The  Rutherford  court did not create a requirement that speciﬁc words must be recited by appellant’s expert. Nor did the  Rutherford  court specify that the testifying expert in asbestos cases must always be ‘somebody with an M.D. after his name.’ The  Rutherford  court agreed with the  Lineaweaver  court that ‘the reference to “medical probability” in the standard “is no more than a recognition that asbestos injury cases (like medical malpractice cases) involve the use of medical evidence.” [Citation.]’ The Supreme Court has since clariﬁed that medical evidence does not necessarily have to be provided by a medical doctor.” ( Hernandez v. Amcord, Inc.  (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 659, 675 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 90], internal citations omitted.) • “Nothing in  Rutherford  precludes a plaintiff from establishing legal causation through opinion testimony by a competent medical expert to the effect that every exposure to respirable asbestos contributes to the risk of developing mesothelioma. On the contrary,  Rutherford  acknowledges the scientiﬁc debate between the ‘every exposure’ and ‘insigniﬁcant exposure’ camps, and recognizes that the conﬂict is one for the jury to resolve.” ( Izell, supra , 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 977.) • “[T]he identiﬁed-exposure theory is a more rigorous standard of causation than the every-exposure theory. As a single example of the difference, we note [expert]’s statement that it ‘takes signiﬁcant exposures’ to increase the risk of disease. This statement uses the plural ‘exposures’ and also requires that those exposures be ‘signiﬁcant.’ The use of ‘signiﬁcant’ as a limiting modiﬁer appears to be connected to [expert]’s earlier testimony about the concentrations of airborne asbestos created by particular activities done by [plaintiff], such as ﬁling, sanding and using an airhose to clean a brake drum.” ( Phillips v.

As a result, a triable issue of fact remained, namely whether the [defendants]’ mascot cavorting in the stands and distracting plaintiff’s attention, while the game was in progress , constituted a breach of that duty, i.e., constituted negligence in the form of increasing the inherent risk to plaintiff of being struck by a foul ball.” ( Lowe, supra , 56 Cal.App.4th at p. 114, original italics.) • “[T]hose responsible for maintaining athletic facilities have a . . . duty not to increase the inherent risks, albeit in the context of businesses selling recreational opportunities.” ( Avila v. Citrus Community College Dist.  (2006) 38 Cal.4th 148, 162 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 131 P.3d 383], internal citation omitted.) • “ Knight , consistently with established case law, simply requires courts in each instance to examine the question of duty in light of the nature of the defendant’s activities and the relationship of the parties to that activity.” ( Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co.  (1997) 15 Cal.4th 456, 482 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 936 P.2d 70].) • “Because primary assumption of risk focuses on the question of duty, it is not dependent on either the plaintiff’s implied consent to, or subjective appreciation of, the potential risk.” ( Griffın, supra,  242 Cal.App.4th at p. 502, original italics.) • “Defendants’ obligation not to increase the risks inherent in the activity included a duty to provide safe equipment for the trip, such as a safe and sound craft.” ( Ferrari v. Grand Canyon Dories  (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 248, 255 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 65].)"}]}

Thus his caution must be adequate to that responsibility as related to all the surrounding circumstances. A pedestrian, on the other hand, has only his own physical body to manage and with which to set in motion a cause of injury. While, usually, that fact limits his capacity to cause injury, as compared with a vehicle driver, still, in exercising ordinary care, he, too, will be alertly conscious of the mechanical power acting, or that may act, on the public roadway, and of the possible, serious consequences from any conﬂict between himself and such forces. And the caution required of him is measured by the possibilities of injury apparent to him in the conditions at hand, or that would be apparent to a person of ordinary prudence in the same position.” ( Cucinella v.

In short, even if a seller had done all that he could reasonably have done to warn about a risk or hazard related to the way a product was designed, it could be that a reasonable person would conclude that the magnitude of the reasonably foreseeable harm as designed outweighed the utility of the product as so designed.” [Citation.] Thus, “most of the evidentiary matters” relevant to applying the risk/beneﬁt test in strict liability cases “are similar to the issues typically presented in a negligent design case.” ’ ” ( Chavez v.

Other courts considering this issue have concluded the defense is not limited to military contracts. . . . [ Boyle’s ] application focuses instead on whether the issue or area is one involving ‘uniquely federal interests’ and, if so, whether the application of state law presents a ‘signiﬁcant conﬂict’ with federal policy.” ( Oxford, supra , 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 710; the split on this issue in the federal and other state courts is noted in  Carley v.

Boeing Co.  (9th Cir. 2011) 654 F.3d 852, 861, internal citation omitted.) • “[T]he operative test for conformity with reasonably precise speciﬁcations turns on whether ‘the alleged defect . . . exist[ed] independently of the design itself.’ ‘To say that a product failed to conform to speciﬁcations is just another way of saying that it was defectively manufactured.’ Therefore, absent some evidence of a latent manufacturing defect, a military contractor can establish conformity with reasonably precise speciﬁcations by showing ‘[e]xtensive government involvement in the design, review, development and testing of a product’ and by demonstrating ‘extensive acceptance and use of the product following production.’ ” ( Getz, supra , 654 F.3d at p. 864, internal citations omitted.) • “[T]he cases recognize that a contractor ‘can demonstrate a fully informed government decision by showing either that they conveyed the relevant known and “substantial enough” dangers . . .  or  that the government did not need the warnings because it already possessed that information.’ ” ( Kase ,  supra , 6 Cal.App.5th at p. 643, original italics, internal citations omitted.) • “Although the source of the government contractor defense is the United States’ sovereign immunity, we have explicitly stated that ‘the government contractor defense does not confer sovereign immunity on contractors.’ ” ( Rodriguez v.

Although the employee may say, ‘I quit,’ the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer’s acts, against the employee’s will. As a result, a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a ﬁring rather than a resignation.” ( Turner, supra,  7 Cal.4th at pp. 1244–1245, internal citation omitted.) • “In order to amount to a constructive discharge, adverse working conditions must be unusually ‘aggravated’ or amount to a ‘continuous pattern’ before the situation will be deemed intolerable. In general, ‘[s]ingle, trivial, or isolated acts of [misconduct] are insufficient’ to support a constructive discharge claim. Moreover, a poor performance rating or a demotion, even when accompanied by reduction in pay, does not by itself trigger a constructive discharge.” ( Turner, supra,  7 Cal.4th at p. 1247, internal citation and fns. omitted.) • “Whether conditions were so intolerable as to justify a reasonable employee’s decision to resign is normally a question of fact.” ( Valdez v.

Such misconduct potentially could be found ‘aggravated.’ ” ( Turner, supra,  7 Cal.4th at p. 1247, fn. 3.) • “Each individual incident need not be sufficient standing alone to force a resignation; rather, the accumulation of discriminatory treatment over time can amount to intolerable working conditions.” ( Brome v.

[¶] For purposes of this standard, the requisite knowledge or intent must exist on the part of either the employer or those persons who effectively represent the employer, i.e., its officers, directors, managing agents, or supervisory employees.” ( Turner, supra,  7 Cal.4th at p. 1251.)"}]}

This step is designed to eliminate at the outset the most patently meritless claims, as where the plaintiff is not a member of the protected class or was clearly unqualiﬁed, or where the job he sought was withdrawn and never ﬁlled. While the plaintiff’s prima facie burden is ‘not onerous’, he must at least show ‘ “actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were ‘based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion . . . .’ . . . .” . . .’ ” ( Guz v.

We agree most individuals who sue exclusively under this deﬁnitional prong likely are and will continue to be victims of an employer’s ‘mistaken’ perception, based on an unfounded fear or stereotypical assumption. Nevertheless, FEHA’s protection is nowhere expressly premised on such a factual showing, and we decline the invitation to import such a requirement.” ( Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp.

The relevant FEHA deﬁnition of an individual regarded as disabled applies only to those who suffer certain speciﬁed physical disabilities or those who have a condition with ‘no present disabling effect’ but which ‘may become a physical disability . . . .’ According to the pleadings, [defendant] ﬁred [plaintiff] to avoid accommodating him because of his association with his physically disabled sister. That is not a basis for liability under the ‘regarded as’ disabled standard.” ( Rope, supra , 220 Cal.App.4th at p. 659, internal citations omitted.) • “ ‘[A]n employer “knows an employee has a disability when the employee tells the employer about his condition, or when the employer otherwise becomes aware of the condition, such as through a third party or by observation.

While knowledge of the disability can be inferred from the circumstances, knowledge will only be imputed to the employer when the fact of disability is the only reasonable interpretation of the known facts. “Vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspeciﬁed incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations . . . .” . . .’ ” ( Scotch v.

Rodriguez,  735 F.3d 1060, 1074–76 (9th Cir. 2013), announced three guiding principles for undertaking the practical factual inquiry of whether an employee’s speech is insulated from employer discipline under the First Amendment. . . . The guiding principles are: [¶] 1. ‘First, particularly in a highly hierarchical employment setting such as law enforcement, whether or not the employee conﬁned his communications to his chain of command is a relevant, if not necessarily dispositive, factor in determining whether he spoke pursuant to his official duties. When a public employee communicates with individuals or entities outside of his chain of command, it is unlikely that he is speaking pursuant to his duties.’ [¶] 2. ‘Second, the subject matter of the communication is also of course highly relevant to the ultimate determination whether the speech is protected by the First Amendment . . . When an employee prepares a routine report, pursuant to normal departmental procedure, about a particular incident or occurrence, the employee’s preparation of that report is typically within his job duties . . . . By contrast, if a public employee raises within the department broad concerns about corruption or systemic abuse, it is unlikely that such complaints can reasonably be classiﬁed as being within the job duties of an average public employee, except when the employee’s regular job duties involve investigating such conduct.’ [¶] 3. ‘Third, we conclude that when a public employee speaks in direct contravention to his supervisor’s orders, that speech may often fall outside of the speaker’s professional duties. Indeed, the fact that an employee is threatened or harassed by his superiors for engaging in a particular type of speech provides strong evidence that the act of speech was not, as a ‘practical’ matter, within the employee’s job duties notwithstanding any suggestions to the contrary in the employee’s formal job description.’ ” ( Brandon v.

The trial court concluded that it may and we agree. So long as the other contracting party continues to demand performance of the increased scope of work, and in the absence of any conﬂicting provision of the contract, the contractor may continue to work after unsuccessful negotiations and subsequently recover the value of that work.
